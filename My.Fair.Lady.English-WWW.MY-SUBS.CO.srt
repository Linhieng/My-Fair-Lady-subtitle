1
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:36,424
WOMAN:
Splendid.

2
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,926
VALET 1:
Sorry, sir, I've already got one there.

3
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,611
VALET 1:
Over here, sir, over here.

4
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,911
VALET 2:
Coming through.

5
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,584
VALET 1:
Over here, sir.

6
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:11,422
VALET 1:
Make way.

7
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,049
ELIZA:
Freddy, oh, it's already very late.

8
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,191
MAN:
Move it, darn it.

9
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,336
Freddy, go and find a cab.

10
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,629
Do you want me
to catch pneumonia?

11
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:09,765
MAN:
Watch out, daffy.

12
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,186
He calls me a daffy.

13
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,191
Don't just stand there, Freddy.
Go and find a cab.

14
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,649
All right, I'll get it. I'll get it.

15
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,704
MAN:
I'm getting wet.

16
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,370
MAN:
I'm so sorry.

17
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,667
Look where you're going, dear.
Look where you're going.

18
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,249
I'm so sorry.

19
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,264
Two bunches of violets
trod in the mud.

20
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,256
A full day's wages.

21
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,588
EYNSFORD-HILL:
Freddy.

22
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,642
Freddy, go and find a cab.

23
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,466
Yes, Mother.

24
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,733
Oh, he's your son, is he?

25
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,185
Well, if you'd done your duty by him
as a mother should,

26
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,306
you wouldn't let him spoil
a poor girl's flowers

27
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,863
and then run away without paying.

28
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,935
Oh, go about your business, my girl.

29
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,072
And you wouldn't go off
without paying either.

30
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,990
Two bunches of violets
trod in the mud.

31
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,867
Good heavens.

32
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,369
- Sir, is there any sign of it stopping?
- I'm afraid not.

33
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,121
- It's worse than before.
- Oh, dear.

34
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,793
If it's worse,
it's a sign it's nearly over.

35
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:20,632
Cheer up, captain.
Buy a flower off a poor girl.

36
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,128
I'm sorry, I haven't any change.

37
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,800
Oh, I can change half a crown.
Here, take this for tuppence.

38
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,639
I told you, I'm awfully sorry,
I haven't--

39
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,264
Oh, wait a minute. Oh, yes.

40
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,641
Here's three ha'pence,
if that's any use to you.

41
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,768
Thank you, sir.

42
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,481
Here, you be careful.
Better give him a flower for it.

43
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:44,403
There is a bloke here
behind that pillar

44
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,862
taking down every blessed word
you're saying.

45
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,503
I ain't done nothing wrong
by speaking to the gentleman.

46
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:56,374
I've a right to sell flowers
if I keep off the curb.

47
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,672
I'm a respectable girl, so help me.

48
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,916
I never spoke to him except to ask him
to buy a flower off me.

49
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,800
MAN 1: Don't start.
- What's all the noise?

50
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,256
There's a tec taking her down.

51
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,796
I'm making an honest living.

52
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,219
MAN 2:
Who's doing all that shouting?

53
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,468
- Where is it coming from?
ELIZA: Well...

54
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,890
Oh, sir, don't let him charge me.
They don't know what it means to me.

55
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,560
They'll take away me character
and drive me on the streets

56
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,189
for speaking to gentlemen.

57
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,056
There, there, there.

58
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,653
Who's hurting you, you silly girl?
What you take me for?

59
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,649
On my Bible oath,
I never spoke a word.

60
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,361
Shut up. Do I look like a policeman?

61
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,201
Then what did you take down
me words for?

62
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,866
How do I know
you took me down right?

63
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,994
You just show me
what you wrote about me.

64
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,749
ELIZA:
Oh.

65
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,749
What's that?
That ain't proper writing.

66
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,501
- I can't read it.
- I can.

67
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:48,933
"I say, captain,
now buy a flower off a poor girl."

68
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,102
Oh, it's because
I called him "captain."

69
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,347
Oh, I meant no harm.

70
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,188
Sir, don't let him lay a charge
against me for a word like that.

71
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,854
I'll make no charge.

72
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,862
Really, sir, if you are a detective,
you needn't begin protecting me

73
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:05,815
against molestation
from young women until I ask you.

74
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,567
Anyone could tell the girl
meant no harm.

75
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:10,359
He ain't no tec.
He's a gentleman.

76
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,623
Look at his boots.

77
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,664
How are all your people
down at Selsey?

78
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,198
Who told you
my people come from Selsey?

79
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,412
Never mind. They do.

80
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,213
How do you come to be
up so far east?

81
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,286
You were born in Lisson Grove.

82
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,013
Oh, what harm is there my leaving
Lisson Grove?

83
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,125
It weren't fit for a pig to live in
and I had to pay 4 and 6 a week--

84
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,973
Live where you like,
but stop that noise.

85
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,558
Come, come, he can't touch you.
You've a right to live where you please.

86
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,925
- I'm a good girl, I am.
- Yes, yes, yes.

87
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,642
Where do I come from?

88
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:40,892
Hoxton.

89
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,563
Well, who said I didn't?
Blimey, you know everything, you do.

90
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:46,863
You, sir, do you think
you could find me a taxi?

91
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,528
I don't know whether you've noticed,
but it's stopped raining.

92
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,817
You can get a motor bus
to Hampton Court.

93
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,571
Well, that's where you live, isn't it?

94
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,453
What impertinence.

95
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,120
Hey, tell him where he comes from,
you wanna go fortune-telling.

96
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,673
Cheltenham,

97
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,825
Harrow,

98
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:09,804
Cambridge and, uh, India?

99
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,627
Quite right.

100
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:13,802
Blimey, he ain't a tec,
he's a blooming busybody.

101
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,141
If I may ask, sir, do you do this sort
of thing for a living at a music hall?

102
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,388
Well, I have thought of it.
Perhaps I will one day.

103
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,270
He's no gentleman.
He ain't, to interfere with a poor girl.

104
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,148
How do you do it, may I ask?

105
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,145
Simple phonetics.
The science of speech.

106
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,858
That's my profession.
Also my hobby.

107
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,819
Anyone can spot an Irishman
or a Yorkshireman by his brogue,

108
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,120
but I can place a man
within six miles.

109
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:37,374
I can place him
within two miles in London.

110
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,237
Sometimes within two streets.

111
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,873
Ought to be ashamed of himself,
unmanly coward.

112
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,121
Is there a living in that?

113
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,372
Oh, yes, quite a fat one.

114
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,884
Let him mind his own business
and leave a poor girl--

115
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,376
Woman! Cease this detestable
boohooing instantly

116
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,380
or else seek the shelter
of some other place of worship.

117
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,258
I have a right to be here if I like,
same as you.

118
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,061
Woman who utters such disgusting
and depressing noises

119
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,636
has no right to be anywhere.
No right to live.

120
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,642
Remember that you're a human being
with a soul

121
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:07,404
and the divine gift
of articulate speech.

122
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,767
That your native language

123
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,573
is the language of Shakespeare
and Milton and the Bible.

124
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,947
Don't sit there
crooning like a bilious pigeon.

125
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,816
Ow!

126
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:20,244
Look at her
A prisoner of the gutters

127
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,713
Condemned by every syllable
She utters

128
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,794
By right
She should be taken out and hung

129
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,961
For the cold-blooded murder
Of the English tongue

130
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,211
Ow!

131
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,762
Heavens! What a sound!

132
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:39,296
This is what the British population
Calls an elementary education.

133
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,063
Come, sir,
I think you picked a poor example.

134
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,016
Did I?

135
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,056
Hear them down in Soho Square

136
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,810
Dropping H's everywhere

137
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:51,232
Speaking English any way they like

138
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,322
Hey, you, sir, did you go to school?

139
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,027
What do you take me for, a fool?

140
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:58,907
Well, no one taught him "take"
Instead of "tike"

141
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:02,446
Hear a Yorkshireman, or worse
Hear a Cornishman converse

142
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,042
I'd rather hear a choir singing flat

143
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,378
Chickens, cackling in a barn
Just like this one

144
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,335
Garn.

145
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,795
"Garn."

146
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:16,125
I ask you, sir,
what sort of word is that?

147
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,512
It's "ow" and "garn"
That keep her in her place

148
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,390
Not her wretched clothes
And dirty face

149
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,101
Why can't the English
Teach their children how to speak?

150
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:30,861
This verbal class distinction
By now, should be antique

151
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:34,525
If you spoke as she does, sir
Instead of the way you do

152
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,315
Why, you might be selling flowers too

153
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,608
PICKERING:
I beg your pardon.

154
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:42,081
An Englishman's way of speaking
Absolutely classifies him

155
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,334
The moment he talks

156
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,906
He makes some other Englishman
Despise him

157
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,252
One common language
I'm afraid we'll never get

158
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,338
Oh, why can't the English learn to

159
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:59,006
Set a good example to people
Whose English is painful to your ears

160
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,508
The Scotch and the Irish
Leave you close to tears

161
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,232
There even are places
Where English completely disappears

162
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,725
Why, in America
They haven't used it for years

163
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:14,319
Why can't the English
Teach their children how to speak?

164
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:17,985
Norwegians learn Norwegian
The Greeks are taught their Greek

165
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:22,155
In France every Frenchman knows
His language from A to Z

166
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,156
The French don't care
what they do actually,

167
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,658
as long as they pronounce it properly.

168
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,464
Arabians learn Arabian
With the speed of summer lightning

169
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,126
The Hebrews learn it backwards
Which is absolutely frightening

170
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,626
Use proper English
You're regarded as a freak

171
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,880
Oh, why can't the English...

172
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:46,969
Why can't the English
Learn to speak?

173
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,319
Thank you.

174
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:57,614
You see this creature
with her curbstone English?

175
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,568
The English that'll keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

176
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,570
Well, sir, in six months,
I could pass her off

177
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,122
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

178
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,906
I could even get her a job
as a lady's maid or a shop assistant,

179
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,580
which requires better English.

180
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,749
Here, what's that you say?

181
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,167
Yes, you squashed cabbage leaf.

182
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,086
You disgrace to the noble architecture
of these columns.

183
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,046
You incarnate insult
to the English language,

184
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,718
I could pass you off
as the Queen of Sheba.

185
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,930
Oh, you don't believe that, captain.

186
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,310
Anything's possible.

187
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,017
I myself am a student
of Indian dialects.

188
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,308
Are you?

189
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,311
Do you know Colonel Pickering,
the author of Spoken Sanskrit?

190
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,694
I am Colonel Pickering.
Who are you?

191
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,902
I'm Henry Higgins,
author of Higgins Universal Alphabet.

192
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:45,533
I came from India to meet you.

193
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,451
I was going to India to meet you.

194
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,040
- Higgins.
- Pickering.

195
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,866
PICKERING: Higgins.
- Where are you staying?

196
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:53,121
At the Carlton.

197
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,922
No, you're not.
You're staying at 27A Wimpole Street.

198
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,246
You come with me.
We'll have a little jaw over supper.

199
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,762
- Right you are.
- Indian dialects always fascinated me.

200
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,915
Buy a flower, kind sir.
I'm short for me lodgings.

201
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,183
Liar.

202
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,215
You said you could change
half a crown.

203
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:10,098
You ought to be stuffed with nails,
you ought.

204
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:14,767
Here, take the whole blooming basket
for sixpence.

205
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:19,072
HIGGINS:
A reminder.

206
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,033
How many are there actually?

207
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,278
PICKERING:
How many what?

208
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,529
HIGGINS:
Indian dialects.

209
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,870
PICKERING:
No fewer than 147 distinct languages

210
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,736
are recorded as vernacular in India.

211
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,200
Ow.

212
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,252
Ah.

213
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,377
MAN 1:
Shouldn't we stand up, gentlemen?

214
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,299
We've got a blooming heiress
in our midst.

215
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,888
Would you be looking
for a good butler, Eliza?

216
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:49,644
Well, you won't do.

217
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:54,267
It's rather dull in town
I think I'll take me to Paris

218
00:14:55,686 --> 00:15:00,186
The missus wants to open up
The castle in Capri

219
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:06,650
Me doctor recommends
A quiet summer by the sea

220
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:16,788
CHORUS :
Wouldn't it be loverly

221
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,629
Where you bound for this year, Eliza?
Biarritz?

222
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:25,297
All I want is a room somewhere

223
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,967
Far away from the cold night air

224
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,219
With one enormous chair

225
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,772
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

226
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:41,978
Lots of chocolate for me to eat

227
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:46,571
Lots of coal makin' lots of heat

228
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,699
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet

229
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:54,407
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

230
00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:02,920
Oh, so loverly sittin'
Abso-bloomin'-lutely still

231
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:11,298
I would never budge till spring
Crept over the windowsill

232
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:15,522
Someone's head restin' on my knee

233
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:20,404
Warm and tender as he can be

234
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,484
Who takes good care of me

235
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:30,241
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

236
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,737
Loverly, loverly

237
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,712
Loverly, loverly

238
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:45,956

Lots of coal makin' lots of heat

00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,782
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet

245
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:14,407
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

246
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:22,456
Oh, so loverly sittin'
Abso-bloomin'-lutely still

Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

252
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,283

Loverly

Wouldn't it be loverly?

260
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:46,267
JAMIE: Come on, Alfie, let's go home
now. This place is giving me the willies.

261
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,346
Home?
What do you want to go home for?

262
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,652
It's nearly 5:00.

263
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,145
My daughter, Eliza,
will be along soon.

264
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,977
She ought to be good
for a half a crown

265
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,363
for a father what loves her.

266
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,779
Loves her? That's a laugh.

267
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,397
You ain't been near her for months.

268
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,864
What's that got to do with it?

269
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,033
What's half a crown
after all I've give her?

270
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:04,332
When did you
ever give her anything?

271
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,536
Anything? I give her everything.

272
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:10,457
I give her the greatest gift
any human being can give to another.

273
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,787
Life.

274
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:16,342
I introduced her to this here planet,
I did, with all its wonders and marvels.

275
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,128
The sun that shines,
the moon that glows.

276
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,353
Hyde Park to walk through
on a fine spring night.

277
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,974
The whole ruddy city of London

278
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,931
to roam around in,
selling her blooming flowers.

279
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,232
I give her all that.

280
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,356
Then I disappears
and leaves her on her own to enjoy it.

281
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,734
Now, if that ain't worth half a crown
now and again,

282
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,732
I'll take my belt off
and give her what for.

283
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,194
You got a good heart, Alfie.

284
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,153
But you want that half a crown
out of Eliza,

285
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,074
you better have a good story
to go with it.

286
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,372
ALFIE:
Leave that to me, my boy.

287
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,700
Good morning, George.

288
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,451
Not a brass farthing.

289
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,787
ALFIE:
Good morning to you, Algernon.

290
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,462
Not a brass farthing.

291
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,090
MAN 1:
Move on, please. Come on.

292
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,667
Get your moving ass out of here.

293
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,633
On with it.

294
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,853
MAN 2:
Veggies. Get your veggies.

295
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,938
Here we are. Nice salad greens.

296
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,525
MAN 3:
Lovely Spanish onion...

297
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,825
MAN 4:
Five pounds...

298
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,379
MAN 2:
This is it. Nice bunches of veggies.

299
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,996
- Take your pick.
- There she is.

300
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,760
MAN 5: Tomatoes over here.
Nice garden tomatoes.

301
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,299
WOMAN:
Very tempting.

302
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,562
Why, Eliza, what a surprise.

303
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,976
Hop along, Charlie,
you're too old for me.

304
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,436
- Don't know your own daughter?
- How you gonna find her

305
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,186
- if you don't know what she looks like?
- I know her. Come on.

306
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,939
I'll find her.

307
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,851
Eliza, what a surprise.

308
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,636
Not a brass farthing.

309
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,349
Here, you come here, Eliza.

310
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,310
I ain't gonna take me
hard-earned wages

311
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:20,361
and let you pass them on
to a bloody pub keeper.

312
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,700
Eliza, you wouldn't have the heart
to send me home to your stepmother

313
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,659
without a drop of liquid protection,
now, would you?

314
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:36,000
Stepmother indeed.

315
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,866
Well, I'm willing to marry her.

316
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,293
It's me that suffers by it.
I'm a slave to that woman, Eliza.

317
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,593
Just because I ain't
her lawful husband.

318
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,008
Come on, slip your old dad
just half a crown to go home on.

319
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,179
Well, I had a bit of luck myself
last night.

320
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,508
Yeah?

321
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:54,392
So here.

322
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,306
But don't keep coming around
counting on half crowns from me.

323
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,601
Thank you, Eliza.

324
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,654
You're a noble daughter.

325
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:09,698
Beer, beer, glorious beer

326
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,566
Fill yourself right up

327
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,413
WOMAN 1:
Do you know where she's been?

328
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:17,328
WOMAN 2:
Yeah, I know. Wayne is always asking.

329
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:21,666
That one, Ginny.

330
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,591
WOMAN 3:
Leave me alone.

331
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,180
HIGGINS: You see this creature
with her curbstone English?

332
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,729
The English that will keep her
in the gutter till the end of her days?

333
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:43,149
In six months, I could pass her off
as a duchess at an Embassy Ball.

334
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,936
I could even get her a job
as a lady's maid or a shop assistant,

335
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,651
which requires better English.

336
00:24:56,536 --> 00:25:00,656
HIGGINS: You disgrace to the noble
architecture of these columns.

337
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,085
I could even get her a job
as a lady's maid or a shop assistant,

338
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,629
which requires better English.

339
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,150
A.

340
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,034
E. U. A...

341
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,413
Now, how many vowel sounds
do you think you heard altogether?

342
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,912
I believe I counted 24.

343
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,253
- Wrong by a hundred.
- What?

344
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,498
To be exact, you heard 130.

345
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,170
Now, listen to them one at a time.

346
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,669
Must I? I'm really quite done up
for one morning.

347
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,954
Your name, please.
Your name, miss.

348
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,999
My name is of no concern
to you whatsoever.

349
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,374
One moment, please.

350
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:35,009
Oh, London is getting
so dirty these days.

351
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,468
PEARCE: I'm Mrs. Pearce,
the housekeeper. Can I help you?

352
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,140
Oh, good morning, missus.

353
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,178
I'd like to see the professor, please.

354
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,892
Could you tell me what it's about?

355
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:48,732
- It's business of a personal nature.
- Oh.

356
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,980
One moment, please.

357
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,369
Mr. Higgins.

358
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:02,788
What is it, Mrs. Pearce?

359
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:05,286
There's a young woman
who wants to see you, sir.

360
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,578
A young woman?

361
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,083
What does she want?

362
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,594
She's quite a common girl, sir.
Very common indeed.

363
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:12,916
I should have sent her away,

364
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,721
only I thought perhaps you wanted her
to talk into your machine.

365
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,715
- Has she an interesting accent?
- Simply ghastly, Mr. Higgins.

366
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,218
Good. Let's have her in.
Show her in, Mrs. Pearce.

367
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,891
Very well, sir. It's for you to say.

368
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:25,889
This is rather a bit of luck.
I'll show you how I make records.

369
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:29,902
We'll set her talking and then I'll take
her down first in Bell's Visible Speech,

370
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,106
then in Broad Romic, and then
we'll get her on the phonograph

371
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,358
so that you can turn her on
whenever you want

372
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,860
with the written transcript
before you.

373
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:42,744
This is the young woman, sir.

374
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,042
Good morning, my good man.

375
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,535
Might I have the pleasure
of a word with you face-to-face?

376
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,038
Oh, no, no, no.
This is the girl I jotted down last night.

377
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:52,210
She's no use. I've got all the records
I want of the Lisson Grove lingo.

378
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,210
I'm not gonna waste
another cylinder on that.

379
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,962
Now, be off with you.
I don't want you.

380
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:59,094
Don't be so saucy.
You ain't heard what I come for yet.

381
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,842
Did you tell him I come in a taxi?

382
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,104
Nonsense, girl.

383
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,175
What do you think a gentleman like
Mr. Higgins cares what you came in?

384
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,142
Oh, we are proud.

385
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,142
Well, he ain't above giving lessons.
Not him.

386
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,444
I heard him say so.

387
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,687
Well, I ain't come here
to ask for any compliment,

388
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,439
and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

389
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,992
Good enough for what?

390
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,855
Good enough for you.

391
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,781
Now you know, don't you?
I'm come to have lessons, I am.

392
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,952
And to pay for them too.
Make no mistake.

393
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,247
Well...

394
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,115
And what do you expect me to say?

395
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,127
Well, if you was a gentleman,
you might ask me to sit down, I think.

396
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,337
Don't I tell you
I'm bringing you business?

397
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,799
Pickering, should we ask this baggage
to sit down

398
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,139
or shall we just throw her
out of the window?

399
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,715
Ow! I won't be called a baggage.

400
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,640
Not when I've offered to pay
like any lady.

401
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,232
PICKERING:
What do you want, my girl?

402
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,610
I-- I want to be a lady in a flower shop

403
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,147
instead of selling at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

404
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,991
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

405
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,657
He said he could teach me.
Well, here I am.

406
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,907
Ready to pay him,
not asking any favor.

407
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,499
And he treats me as if I was dirt.

408
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:12,915
I know what lessons cost as well
as you do, and I'm ready to pay.

409
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,127
How much?

410
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,418
Now you're talking.

411
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:22,262
I thought you'd come off it when you
saw a chance of getting back

412
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,799
a bit of what you chucked at me.

413
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,892
- You'd had a drop in, hadn't you, eh?
- Sit down.

414
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,848
If you're going to make
a compliment of it--

415
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:31,138
Sit down!

416
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:33,942
Sit down, girl. Do as you're told.

417
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:35,397
What's your name?

418
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,027
Eliza Doolittle.

419
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,744
Won't you sit down, Miss Doolittle?

420
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,284
Oh.

421
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,832
I don't mind if I do.

422
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:52,746
Now, how much do you propose
to pay me for these lessons?

423
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,367
Oh, I know what's right.

424
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,344
A lady friend of mine gets French
lessons for 18 pence an hour

425
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,585
from a real French gentleman.

426
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,838
Well, you wouldn't have the face
to ask me the same

427
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,590
for teaching me my own language
as you would for French.

428
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,303
So I won't give more than a shilling.

429
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,473
Take it or leave it.

430
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:15,021
Do you know, Pickering, if you think
of a shilling not as a simple shilling

431
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,980
but as a percentage
of this girl's income,

432
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:22,031
it works out as fully equivalent

433
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,664
of 60 or 70 pounds
from a millionaire.

434
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:29,155
By George, it's enormous.
It's the biggest offer I ever had.

435
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,539
Sixty pounds?

436
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,996
What are you talking about?
Where would I get 60 pounds?

437
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,417
I never offered you 60 pounds.

438
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,785
- Hold your tongue.
- But I ain't got 60 pounds.

439
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,382
Don't cry, you silly girl.

440
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,917
Sit down.
Nobody's going to touch your money.

441
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,011
Somebody's going to touch you
with a broomstick

442
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,547
if you don't stop sniveling.
Sit down!

443
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,926
Oh, anybody would think
you was my father.

444
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,812
If I decide to teach you,
I'll be worse than two fathers to you.

445
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,520
Here.

446
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,021
- What's this for?
- To wipe your eyes.

447
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,034
To wipe any part of your face
that feels moist.

448
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,697
And remember, that's your
handkerchief and that's your sleeve.

449
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,486
And don't confuse the one
with the other

450
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,280
if you want to become
a lady in a shop.

451
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,583
It's no use to talk to her like that,
Mr. Higgins.

452
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,117
She doesn't understand you.

453
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,040
Here, give the handkerchief to me.
He give it to me, not to you.

454
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,131
Higgins, I'm interested.

455
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,836
What about your boast that you
could pass her off as a duchess

456
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,377
at the Embassy Ball, eh?

457
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,381
I'll say you're the greatest teacher alive
if you can make that good.

458
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:31,354
I'll bet you all the expenses
of the experiment that you can't do it.

459
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,466
I'll even pay for the lessons.

460
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:36,443
Oh, you're real good.
Thank you, captain.

461
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:40,982
You know, it's almost irresistible.

462
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,653
She's so deliciously low.

463
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,321
So horribly dirty.

464
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:47,569
I ain't dirty.

465
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,910
I washed my face and hands
before I come, I did.

466
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,156
I'll take it.

467
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:54,327
I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

468
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:58,167
We'll start today. Now. This moment.
Take her away and clean her.

469
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,174
Sandpaper if it won't come off
any other way.

470
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,416
- Is there a good fire in the kitchen?
- Yes, but--

471
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:05,009
Take all her clothes, burn them,
and order new ones.

472
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,304
Just wrap her in brown paper
till they come.

473
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,346
You're no gentleman.
You're not to talk of such things.

474
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,974
I'm a good girl, I am.

475
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,391
And I know what the likes of you are,
I do.

476
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,851
We want none of your
slum prudery here, young woman.

477
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,193
You've got to learn to behave
like a duchess.

478
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:23,648
Now take her away, Mrs. Pearce.

479
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,568
If she gives you any trouble,
wallop her.

480
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,647
I'll call the police, I will.

481
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,402
I've got no place to put her.

482
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,244
- Well, put her in the dustbin.
- Ow!

483
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,620
Come, Higgins, be reasonable.

484
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,997
You must be reasonable, Mr. Higgins,
really, you must.

485
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,825
You can't walk
over everybody like this.

486
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,172
I?

487
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,049
Walk over everybody?

488
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,505
My dear Mrs. Pearce,
my dear Pickering.

489
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,506
I had no intention
of walking over anybody.

490
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,548
I merely suggested
we should be kind to this poor girl.

491
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,603
I didn't express myself clearly

492
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,557
because I didn't wish to hurt
her delicacy.

493
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,808
Or yours.

494
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,109
But, sir, you can't take a girl up
like that

495
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,694
as if you were
picking up a pebble on the beach.

496
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,070
Why not?

497
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:08,356
Why not?

498
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,029
But you don't know
anything about her.

499
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,948
What about her parents?
She may be married.

500
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:14,527
Garn.

501
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:18,292
There.
As the girl very properly says, "Garn."

502
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,076
Who'd marry me?

503
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,037
By George, Eliza.

504
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,633
The streets will be strewn
with the bodies of men

505
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,880
shooting themselves for your sake
before I'm done with you.

506
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:36,296
Here. I'm going.

507
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,394
He's off his chump, he is.

508
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,099
- I don't want no barmies teaching me.
- Oh, mad, am I?

509
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,440
All right,
don't ring up and order those clothes.

510
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:45,856
- Throw her out.
- Stop, Mr. Higgins, I won't allow it.

511
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,185
Go home to your parents.

512
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,030
I ain't got no parents.

513
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,815
There you are.
She ain't got no parents.

514
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,489
What's all the fuss?
Nobody wants her.

515
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,657
She's no use to anybody but me.
Take her upstairs.

516
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,116
But what's to become of her?
Is she to be paid anything?

517
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,286
Oh, do be sensible, sir.

518
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,865
What would she do with money?
She'll have food and clothes.

519
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,671
She'll only drink
if you give her money.

520
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,165
Oh, you are a brute. It's a lie.

521
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,586
Nobody ever saw
the sign of liquor on me.

522
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,755
Oh, sir, you're a gentleman.
Don't let him speak to me like that.

523
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,925
Does it occur to you, Higgins,
the girl has some feelings?

524
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,425
Oh, no, I don't think so.
No feelings we need worry about.

525
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,678
Well, have you, Eliza?

526
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,220
I got my feelings
same as anyone else.

527
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,604
Mr. Higgins, I must know
on what terms the girl is to be here.

528
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,232
What's to become of her
when you've finished your teaching?

529
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,020
You must look ahead a little, sir.

530
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,363
What's to become of her
if we leave her in the gutter?

531
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:34,819
- Answer me that, Mrs. Pearce.
- That's her own business, not yours.

532
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:38,121
When I'm done, we'll throw her back,
then it will be her own business again.

533
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,624
That will be all right, won't it?

534
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:42,497
You've no feeling heart in you.

535
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,205
You don't care for nothing
but yourself.

536
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,876
I've had enough of this.
I'm going, I am.

537
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,956
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,
you ought.

538
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,421
Have some chocolates, Eliza.

539
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,009
How do I know
what might be in them?

540
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,563
I've heard of girls being drugged
by the likes of you.

541
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,768
Pledge of good faith.

542
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,188
I'll take one half

543
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:10,437
and you take the other.

544
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,818
You'll have boxes of them,
barrels of them every day.

545
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,371
You'll live on them, eh?

546
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,158
I wouldn't have ate it,
only I'm too ladylike

547
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,620
to take it out of my mouth.

548
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,870
Think of it, Eliza.

549
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:30,131
Think of chocolates
and taxis and gold and diamonds.

550
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,586
Ow! I don't want no gold
and no diamonds.

551
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,508
I'm a good girl, I am.

552
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:38,966
Higgins, I really must interfere.
Mrs. Pearce is quite right.

553
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,808
If this girl's gonna put herself
in your hands for six months

554
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,394
for an experiment in teaching,

555
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,979
she must understand thoroughly
what she's doing.

556
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,188
HIGGINS:
Mm.

557
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,727
Eliza, you are to stay here
for the next six months

558
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:57,952
learning how to speak beautifully,
like a lady in a florist shop.

559
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,066
If you're good
and do whatever you're told,

560
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,293
you shall sleep in a proper bedroom,
have lots to eat

561
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:07,164
and money to buy chocolates
and take rides in taxis.

562
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,583
But if you are naughty and idle,

563
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,542
you shall sleep in the back kitchen
amongst the black beetles

564
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:16,173
and be walloped by Mrs. Pearce
with a broomstick.

565
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,633
At the end of six months,

566
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,143
you shall be taken
to Buckingham Palace

567
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,885
in a carriage, beautifully dressed.

568
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,849
If the king finds out
that you're not a lady,

569
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,230
the police will take you
to the Tower of London

570
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,228
where your head will be cut off

571
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,360
as a warning
to other presumptuous flower girls.

572
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:40,784
But if you are not found out,
you shall have a present

573
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,830
of seven and six to start life with
as a lady in a shop.

574
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,366
If you refuse this offer,

575
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:51,830
you will be the most ungrateful,
wicked girl

576
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,593
and the angels will weep for you.

577
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,216
Now, are you satisfied, Pickering?

578
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,218
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

579
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,640
Oh, could I put it more plainly
or fairly, Mrs. Pearce?

580
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:07,889
Come with me, Eliza.

581
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,520
That's right, Mrs. Pearce.
Bundle her off to the bathroom.

582
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,898
You're a great bully, you are.

583
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,815
I won't stay here if I don't like it.
I won't let nobody wallop me.

584
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:16,983
Don't answer back, girl.

585
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:20,321
ELIZA: If I'd known what I was letting
myself in for, I wouldn't have come here.

586
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,858
I've always been a good girl,
I am, and I won't be put upon.

587
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,124
In six months--

588
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,275
In three if she has a good ear
and a quick tongue.

589
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,874
--I'll take her anywhere
and I'll pass her off as anything.

590
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,330
I'll make a queen
of that barbarous wretch.

591
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,419
ELIZA:
I've never had a bath in my life.

592
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,013
Not what you'd call a proper one.

593
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,298
You know, you can't be a nice girl
inside if you're dirty outside.

594
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:50,024
I'll have to put you in here.
This will be your bedroom.

595
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:58,861
Oh, I couldn't sleep here, missus.
It's too good for the likes of me.

596
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,896
I should be afraid to touch anything.

597
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,993
I ain't a duchess yet, you know?

598
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:13,042
Oh, what's this?
This where you wash clothes?

599
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,959
This is where we wash
ourselves, Eliza.

600
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,877
And where I'm going to wash you.

601
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,012
You expect me to get into that
and wet myself all over?

602
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,625
Not me.

603
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,846
I shall catch my death.

604
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,055
Come along now.

605
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,901
Come along. Take your clothes off.

606
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,192
Come on, girl, do as you're told.
Take your clothes off.

607
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,073
- Here, come on, help me take these.
- Ow! No, I won't.

608
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,952
PEARCE: Come out of that.
- No, I won't.

609
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,699
PEARCE: Everyone.
- No!

610
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,830
I won't. Take your hands off me.

611
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,079
- No.
PEARCE: Oh, dear.

612
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,620
No. Ow!

613
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,040
- No, I won't. Let go.
PEARCE: Eliza, keep still.

614
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,559
PEARCE: Take a bath.
- No!

615
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:13,726
No!

616
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,814
I'm a good girl, I am.

617
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,808
PEARCE: Well, they won't like the
smell of you if you don't have a bath.

618
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:21,691
ELIZA:
It ain't right. It ain't decent.

619
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,861
Let go of my coat.

620
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,320
ELIZA:
Take your hands off me.

621
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,163
PEARCE:
Come here.

622
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,697
ELIZA: No.
PEARCE: I won't hurt you.

623
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,502
ELIZA:
Let me go.

624
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,536
Take your hands off me.

625
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,710
I'm a good girl, I am.

626
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,706
Take your hands off me, you hear.

627
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,723
PEARCE:
Eliza, I won't have it.

628
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,465
I wouldn't hurt you.

629
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,889
Higgins, forgive the bluntness,

630
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,311
but if I'm to be in this business,
I shall feel responsible for the girl.

631
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,771
I hope it's clearly understood
that no advantage

632
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:02,231
is to be taken of her position.

633
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,981
What, that thing?
Sacred, I assure you.

634
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,784
Come now, Higgins,
you know what I mean.

635
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,147
This is no trifling matter.

636
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,664
Are you a man of good character
where women are concerned?

637
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,331
Have you ever met a man
of good character

638
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,577
where women are concerned?

639
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,208
Yes, very frequently.

640
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,456
Well, I haven't.

641
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,957
I find the moment
I let a woman make friends with me,

642
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:26,169
she becomes jealous, exacting,
suspicious and a damned nuisance.

643
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,682
And I find the moment
that I make friends with a woman,

644
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,434
I become selfish and tyrannical.

645
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:34,346
So here I am, a confirmed old bachelor
and likely to remain so.

646
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:38,887
Well, after all, Pickering
I'm an ordinary man

647
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:43,403
Who desires nothing more
Than just an ordinary chance

648
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:48,187
To live exactly as he likes
And do precisely what he wants

649
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,704
An average man am I
Of no eccentric whim

650
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:55,988
Who likes to live his life
Free of strife

651
00:40:56,203 --> 00:41:00,043
Doing whatever he thinks
Is best for him

652
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,672
Well, just an ordinary man

653
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:11,835
But let a woman in your life
And your serenity is through

654
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:14,802
She'll redecorate your home
From the cellar to the dome

655
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,894
Then go on to the enthralling fun
Of overhauling you

656
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:25,522
Let a woman in your life
And you're up against a wall

657
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,493
Make a plan and you will find
She has something else in mind

658
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,654
And so rather than do either
You do something else

659
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,413
That neither likes at all

660
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:39,454
You want to talk of Keats or Milton
She only wants to talk of love

661
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:44,963
You go to see a play or ballet
And spend it searching for her glove

662
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:50,509
Let a woman in your life
And you invite eternal strife

663
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:56,891
Let them buy their wedding bands
For those anxious little hands

664
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,927
I'd be equally as willing
For a dentist to be drilling

665
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,812
Than to ever let a woman in my life

666
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:10,613
I'm a very gentle man
Even-tempered and good-natured

667
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,699
Who you never hear complain

668
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:17,195
Who has the milk of human kindness
By the quart in every vein

669
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:21,659
A patient man am I
Down to my fingertips

670
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,872
The sort who never could
Ever would

671
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:29,094
Let an insulting remark escape his lips

672
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,800
A very gentle man

673
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:41,144
But let a woman in your life
And patience hasn't got a chance

674
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,770
She will beg you for advice
Your reply will be concise

675
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:45,398
And she'll listen very nicely

676
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,944
Then go out
And do precisely what she wants

677
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:54,775
You are a man of grace and polish
Who never spoke above a hush

678
00:42:54,989 --> 00:43:00,579
Now all at once you're using language
That would make a sailor blush

679
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:05,786
Let a woman in your life
And you're plunging in a knife

680
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:12,297
Let the others of my sex
Tie the knot around their necks

681
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,626
I'd prefer a new edition
Of the Spanish Inquisition

682
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:19,763
Than to ever let a woman in my life

683
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,229
I'm a quiet-living man

684
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,475
Who prefers to spend the evenings
In the silence of his room

685
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:32,939
Who likes an atmosphere as restful
As an undiscovered tomb

686
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:37,412
A pensive man am I
Of philosophic joys

687
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,735
Who likes to meditate, contemplate

688
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:46,041
Free from humanity's mad
Inhuman noise

689
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,541
A quiet living man

690
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:57,429
But let a woman in your life
And your sabbatical is through

691
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,295
In a line that never ends
Come an army of her friends

692
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,682
Come to jabber and to chatter

693
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,059
And to tell her what the matter
Is with you

694
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,229
She'll have a booming
Boisterous family

695
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,107
Who will descend
On you en masse

696
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:16,435
She'll have a large Wagnerian mother
With a voice that shatters glass

697
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,404
Let a woman in your life

698
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:22,527
Let a woman in your life

699
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:46,675
I shall never let a woman in my life

700
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:49,976
MAN:
Get out of here.

701
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,517
The two of you get out too.

702
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,860
Come on, Doolittle.

703
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:57,395
And remember,
drinks are to be paid for or not drunk.

704
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,105
Thanks for your hospitality, George.

705
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,372
Send the bill to Buckingham Palace.
Come on.

706
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,914
Well, Alfie, there's nothing else to do.
I guess it's back to work.

707
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,160
What?

708
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,961
Don't you dare mention
that word in my presence again.

709
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,455
Look at all these poor blighters
down here.

710
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,208
I used to do that sort of thing once,
just for exercise.

711
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:20,343
It's not worth it.
Takes up your whole day.

712
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,011
Oh, don't worry, boys.
We'll get out of this somehow.

713
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,140
How do you think
you're going to do that, Alfie?

714
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,637
How? Same as always.

715
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,940
Faith, hope and a little bit of luck.

716
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,645
The Lord above gave man
An arm of iron

717
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:38,607
So he could do his job
And never shirk

718
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:42,949
The Lord above gave man
An arm of iron but

719
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:46,527
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

720
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:50,544
Someone else'll do
The blinkin' work

721
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:54,418
With a little bit
With a little bit

722
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:58,166
ALL : With a little bit of luck
You'll never work

723
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,920
The Lord above made liquor
For temptation

724
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:05,684
To see if man could turn away
From sin

725
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:10,018
The Lord above made liquor
For temptation but

726
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,595
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

727
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:17,612
When temptation comes
You'll give right in

728
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:21,396
With a little bit
With a little bit

729
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,952
With a little bit of luck
You'll give right in

730
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,907
Oh, you can walk
The straight and narrow

731
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,829
But with a little bit of luck
You'll run amuck

732
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,500
The gentle sex
Was made for man to marry

733
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:40,300
To share his nest
And see his food is cooked

734
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:44,676
The gentle sex
Was made for man to marry but

735
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,255
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

736
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:52,272
You can have it all
And not get hooked

737
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:56,146
With a little bit
With a little bit

738
00:46:56,355 --> 00:47:00,065
With a little bit of luck
You won't get hooked

739
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,945
With a little bit
With a little bit

740
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:07,624
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

741
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:11,445
They're always throwin'
Goodness at you

742
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:15,372
But with a little bit of luck
A man can duck

743
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:19,132
The Lord above made man
To help his neighbor

744
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:22,916
No matter where
On land, or sea, or foam

745
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:27,391
The Lord above made man
To help his neighbor but

746
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:30,974
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

747
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,101
When he comes around
You won't be home

748
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:37,773
With a little bit
With a little bit

749
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,943
With a little bit of luck
You won't be home

750
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,861
With a little bit
With a little bit

751
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:51,082
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

752
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:52,873
HARRY:
You make a good suffragette, Alfie.

753
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:55,538
MAN:
Oh, get along with you.

754
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,297
Why, there's the lucky man now.

755
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,625
The Honorable Alfie Doolittle.

756
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,632
What are you doing in Eliza's house?

757
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,394
Her former residence.

758
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,927
You can buy your own drinks now,
Alfie Doolittle.

759
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,981
Fallen into a tub of butter, you have.

760
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,194
- What are you talking about?
- Your daughter, Eliza.

761
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,266
You're a lucky man, Alfie Doolittle.

762
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,111
Well, what about Eliza?

763
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:27,067
Oh! He don't know.
Her own father and he don't know.

764
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,236
Moved in with a swell, Eliza has.

765
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,452
Left here in a taxi all by herself,
smart as paint.

766
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,673
- And ain't been home for three days.
- Go on.

767
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,125
Then this morning,
I get a message from her.

768
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,416
She wants her things sent over.

769
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,720
To 27A Wimpole Street,

770
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:50,005
care of Professor Higgins.

771
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,723
- And what things does she want?
- What?

772
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,351
Her birdcage and her Chinese fan.

773
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:01,850
"But," she says,

774
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:06,154
"never mind about
sending any clothes."

775
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:11,817
I knew she had a career
in front of her.

776
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:14,372
Harry boy,
we're in for a booze-up.

777
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:18,196
The sun is shining
on Alfred P. Doolittle.

778
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:22,043
A man was made
To help support his children

779
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,800
Which is the right
And proper thing to do

780
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:30,174
A man was made
To help support his children but

781
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,684
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

782
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:37,847
They'll go out
And start supporting you

783
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,518
With a little bit
With a little bit

784
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:45,438
With a little bit of luck
They'll work for you

785
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:49,149
With a little bit
With a little bit

786
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:53,161
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

787
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,247
Oh, it's a crime
For man to go philanderin'

788
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:08,049
And fill his wife's poor heart
With grief and doubt

789
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:12,255
Oh, it's a crime
For a man to go philanderin' but

790
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:15,847
With a little bit of luck
With a little bit of luck

791
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:19,774
You can see
The bloodhound don't find out

792
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,595
With a little bit
With a little bit

793
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,982
With a little bit of luck
She won't find out

794
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,360
MAN: Charlie, over here.
- With a little bit

795
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,238
With a little bit

796
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:35,865
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

797
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:43,504
With a little bit of bloomin' luck

798
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,342
The mail, sir.

799
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,469
Pay the bills
and say no to the invitations.

800
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:58,676
ELIZA:
A.

801
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:02,349
A.

802
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:08,189
A.

803
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:14,398
A.

804
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:36,428
A.

805
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:40,295
A!

806
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,684
You simply cannot go on
working the girl this way.

807
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,061
Making her say her alphabet
over and over

808
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:48,058
from sunup to sundown,
even during meals.

809
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:50,611
You'll exhaust yourself.
When will it stop?

810
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,646
When she does it properly,
of course.

811
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,489
Is that all, Mrs. Pearce?

812
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:55,744
There's another letter

813
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,986
from that American millionaire,
Ezra D. Wallingford.

814
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,488
He still wants you to lecture
for his Moral Reform League.

815
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,740
Yes, well, throw it away.

816
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,702
It's the third letter
he's written you, sir.

817
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,702
- You should at least answer it.
- All right.

818
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,584
Leave it on the desk, Mrs. Pearce.
I'll try and get to it.

819
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,884
If you please, sir,
there's a dustman downstairs,

820
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,589
Alfred P. Doolittle,
who wants to see you.

821
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,880
He says you have his daughter here.

822
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,974
PICKERING:
I say.

823
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,639
Well, send the blackguard up.

824
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,018
PICKERING:
He may not be a blackguard, Higgins.

825
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,345
Nonsense. Of course
he's a blackguard, Pickering.

826
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:30,691
Whether he is or not, I'm afraid
we'll have some trouble with him.

827
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:31,937
No, I think not.

828
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,279
Any trouble to be had,
he'll have it with me, not I with him.

829
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,283
Doolittle, sir.

830
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,122
Professor Higgins?

831
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,000
HIGGINS:
Here.

832
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,747
Where?

833
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,839
Oh, good morning, governor.

834
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:57,014
I come about
a very serious matter, governor.

835
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:02,141
Brought up in Hounslow.

836
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,135
Mother Welsh, I should think.

837
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:06,678
What is it you want, Doolittle?

838
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,562
I want my daughter,
that's what I want, you see?

839
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,979
Well, of course you do.
You're her father, aren't you?

840
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,569
I'm glad to see you have
a spark of family feeling left.

841
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,904
She's in there.
Yes, take her away at once.

842
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,112
What?

843
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:20,361
Take her away.

844
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,072
Do you think I am going
to keep your daughter for you?

845
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,993
Now, is this reasonable, governor?

846
00:53:26,203 --> 00:53:29,213
Is it fairity to take advantage
of a man like that?

847
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,334
The girl belongs to me. You got her.

848
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,791
Where do I come in?

849
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:37,211
How dare you come here
and attempt to blackmail me.

850
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,302
You sent her here on purpose.

851
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:43,047
Now, don't take a man
up like that, governor.

852
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,431
The police shall take you up.

853
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:47,466
This is a plan, a plot
to extort money by threats.

854
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:49,522
I shall telephone the police.

855
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,056
Have I asked you
for a brass farthing?

856
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:56,901
I'll leave it to this gentleman here.
Have I said a word about money?

857
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,898
What else did you come for?

858
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,740
Well...

859
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,156
What would a bloke come for?

860
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,365
Be human, governor.

861
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,040
Alfred, you sent her here
on purpose.

862
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:14,920
So help me, governor, I never did.

863
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:16,496
Then how did you know
she was here?

864
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,421
I'd tell you, governor,
if you'd only let me get a word in.

865
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:22,551
I'm willing to tell you.
I'm wanting to tell you.

866
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,049
I'm waiting to tell you.

867
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,386
You know, Pickering,

868
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,387
this chap's got
a certain natural gift of rhetoric.

869
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,390
Observe the rhythm
of his native woodnotes wild.

870
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,693
"I'm willing to tell you.
I'm wanting to tell you.

871
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:40,107
I'm waiting to tell you."
That's the Welsh strain in him.

872
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,948
How did you know Eliza was here
if you didn't send her?

873
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:46,164
Well, she sent back for her luggage
and I got to hear about it.

874
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:49,576
She said she didn't want no clothes.

875
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,366
What was I to think from that,
governor?

876
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,619
I ask you, as a parent,
what was I to think?

877
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,753
So you came here to rescue her
from worse than death, eh?

878
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,422
Just so, governor, that's right.

879
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,710
Yes.

880
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:03,553
Mrs. Pearce.

881
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:06,718
Mrs. Pearce, Eliza's father
has come to take her away.

882
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,048
Give her to him, will you?

883
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:12,473
Now, wait a minute, governor,
wait a minute.

884
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,564
You and me is men of the world,
ain't we?

885
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:18,310
Oh, men of the world, are we?

886
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,903
- Yes, you better go, Mrs. Pearce.
- I think so indeed, sir.

887
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,150
Here, governor.

888
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:27,031
I've took a sort of a fancy
to you and--

889
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,156
If you want the girl, well, I ain't so set
on having her back home again,

890
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:36,671
but what I might be
open to is an arrangement.

891
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:39,205
All I ask is my rights as a father.

892
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:43,129
You're the last man alive
to expect me to let her go for nothing.

893
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,510
Oh, I can see you're one
of the straight sort, governor.

894
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:49,638
So, what's a 5-pound note to you?

895
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:52,506
And what's Eliza to me?

896
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,184
I think you ought to know, Doolittle,

897
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:57,312
that Mr. Higgins' intentions
are entirely honorable.

898
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,230
Of course they are, governor.

899
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:01,939
If I thought they wasn't, I'd ask 50.

900
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,240
Do you mean to say you'd sell
your daughter for 50 pounds?

901
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:06,945
Have you no morals, man?

902
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:11,406
No, no,
I can't afford them, governor.

903
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,738
Neither could you
if you was as poor as me.

904
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,373
Not that I mean any harm,
mind you.

905
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,420
But if Eliza is gonna have
a bit out of this,

906
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,825
why not me too, eh?

907
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,094
Why not?

908
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:26,755
Well, look at it my way.

909
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,926
What am I? I ask you, what am I?

910
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,546
I'm one of the undeserving poor,
that's what I am.

911
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,644
Now, think
what that means to a man.

912
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:39,019
It means he's up against
middle-class morality for all of time.

913
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,519
If there's anything going
and I puts in for a bit of it,

914
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:42,821
it's always the same story.

915
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,784
"You're undeserving
so you can't have it."

916
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,985
But my needs is as great
as the most deserving widows

917
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:52,197
that ever got money out
of six different charities in one week

918
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,539
for the death of the same husband.

919
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:58,414
I don't need less than
a deserving man, I need more.

920
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,793
I don't eat less hearty than he does.

921
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,790
And I drink, oh, a lot more.

922
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:07,843
I'm playing straight with you.
I ain't pretending to be deserving.

923
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,089
No, I'm undeserving.

924
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,301
And I mean to go on
being undeserving.

925
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,222
I like it, and that's the truth.

926
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:18,271
But will you take advantage
of a man's nature

927
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,346
to do him out of the price
of his own daughter,

928
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:24,982
what he's brought up, fed and clothed
by the sweat of his brow

929
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,531
till she's growed big enough

930
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:30,574
to be interesting
to you two gentlemen?

931
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:35,280
Well, is 5 pounds unreasonable?
I put it to you.

932
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,703
And I leave it to you.

933
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,418
You know, Pickering, if we took
this man in hand for three months,

934
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,416
he could choose
between a seat in the cabinet

935
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:48,208
and a popular pulpit in Wales.

936
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,923
We'd better give him a fiver.

937
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,093
He'll make bad use of it, I'm afraid.

938
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,222
Oh, not me, governor.
So help me, I won't.

939
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:56,809
Just one good spree
for myself and the missus.

940
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,095
Giving pleasure to ourselves
and employment to others.

941
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,980
And satisfaction to you to know
it ain't been thrown away.

942
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,398
You couldn't spend it better.

943
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,226
Oh, this is irresistible.
Let's give him 10.

944
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,152
No, the missus wouldn't have the heart
to spend 10, governor.

945
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:11,951
Ten pounds is a lot of money.

946
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:15,865
Makes a man feel prudent-like,
and then goodbye to happiness.

947
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:20,365
No, you give me what I ask, governor.
Not a penny less, not a penny more.

948
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:23,540
I rather draw the line at encouraging
this sort of immorality, Doolittle.

949
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,580
Why don't you marry
that missus of yours, eh?

950
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,753
After all, marriage isn't so frightening.
You married Eliza's mother.

951
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,763
Who told you that, governor?

952
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:34,795
Well, nobody told me.
I concluded, naturally.

953
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,774
If we listen to this man
for another minute,

954
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,354
we shall have no convictions left.

955
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,189
- Five pounds, I think you said.
- Thank you, governor, thank you.

956
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,645
Are you sure you won't have 10?

957
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,475
- No, no, perhaps another time.
- I won't, I won't, I won't.

958
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,192
I beg your pardon, miss.

959
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:54,032
ELIZA: I won't say those ruddy vowels
one more time.

960
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,029
Blimey, it's Eliza.

961
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,701
Well, I never thought
she'd clean up so good-looking.

962
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,740
She does me credit,
don't she, governor?

963
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,334
Here, what you doing here?

964
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,040
Now, now, you hold your tongue.

965
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:08,290
And don't you give these gentlemen
none of your lip.

966
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:10,213
If you have any trouble
with her, governor,

967
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,801
give her a few licks of the strap.

968
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,336
That's the way to improve her mind.

969
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:15,971
Well, good morning, gentlemen.

970
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,467
- Cheerio, Eliza.
- Mah!

971
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:21,972
There's a man for you.

972
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,733
A philosophical genius
of the first water.

973
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,106
Mrs. Pearce,
write to Mr. Ezra Wallingford

974
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,734
and tell him if he wants a lecturer

975
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:31,781
to get in touch
with Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle,

976
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:34,565
a common dustman, one of the most
original moralists in England.

977
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,859
Yes, sir.

978
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,952
Here, what did he come for?

979
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,197
Say your vowels.

980
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,159
I know my vowels.
I knew them before I come.

981
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,489
If you know them, say them.

982
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,464
A, E, I, O, U.

983
00:59:45,665 --> 00:59:46,915
Stop.

984
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,285
A, E, I, O, U.

985
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,302
That's what said, A, E, I, O, U.

986
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:54,085
That's what I been saying
for three days

987
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,469
and I won't say them no more.

988
00:59:55,633 --> 00:59:58,643
I know it's difficult, Miss Doolittle,
but try to understand.

989
00:59:58,845 --> 01:00:00,295
There's no use explaining, Pickering.

990
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,103
As a military man, you know that.
Drilling is what she needs.

991
01:00:03,308 --> 01:00:05,928
Now, leave her alone or she'll be
turning to you for sympathy.

992
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:09,194
Very well, if you insist, but have
a little patience with her, Higgins.

993
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,767
Of course.

994
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:12,362
Now say "A."

995
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,607
You ain't got no heart, you ain't.

996
01:00:14,819 --> 01:00:16,949
- A.
- A.

997
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,065
- A.
- A.

998
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,032
- A.
- A.

999
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,332
Eliza.

1000
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:26,405
I promise you, you'll say your vowels
correctly before this day is out

1001
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,003
or there'll be no lunch, no dinner

1002
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:32,128
and no chocolates.

1003
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:46,772
Just you wait, Henry Higgins
Just you wait

1004
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:51,266
You'll be sorry
But your tears will be too late

1005
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:53,611
You'll be broke
And I'll have money

1006
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,896
Will I help you?
Don't be funny

1007
01:00:56,110 --> 01:01:00,660
Just you wait, Henry Higgins
Just you wait

1008
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:04,785
Just you wait, Henry Higgins,
Till you're sick

1009
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:09,334
And you screams
To fetch a doctor double-quick

1010
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:14,000
I'll be off a second later
And go straight to the theater

1011
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:18,472
Ho, ho, ho, Henry Higgins
Just you wait

1012
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:22,802
Ooh, Henry Higgins

1013
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:27,602
Just you wait
Until we're swimmin' in the sea

1014
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,267
Ooh, Henry Higgins

1015
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:35,859
And you gets a cramp
A little ways from me

1016
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:37,937
When you yell you're gonna drown

1017
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,282
I'll get dressed and go to town

1018
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,488
Ho, ho, ho, Henry Higgins

1019
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,159
Ho, ho, ho, Henry Higgins

1020
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:49,788
Just you wait

1021
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:54,786
One day I'll be famous

1022
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,342
I'll be proper and prim

1023
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,837
Go to St. James so often

1024
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,629
I will call it St. Jim

1025
01:02:03,302 --> 01:02:06,012
One evening the king will say:

1026
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,812
"Oh, Liza, old thing

1027
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:11,766
I want all of England

1028
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:15,108
Your praises to sing"

1029
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:19,574
Next week on the 20th of May

1030
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:25,067
I proclaim Liza Doolittle Day

1031
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:30,083
All the people will celebrate
The glory of you

1032
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:35,958
And whatever you wish and want
I gladly will do

1033
01:02:36,169 --> 01:02:41,839
"Thanks a lot, king," says I
In a manner well-bred

1034
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:47,389
"But all I want is Henry Higgins' head"

1035
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:52,774
- Done
- Says the king with a stroke

1036
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:57,107
Guard, run and bring in the bloke

1037
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:02,105
Then they'll march you, Henry Higgins
To the wall

1038
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,910
- And the king will tell me:
- Liza, sound the call

1039
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:10,036
As they raise their rifles higher

1040
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:13,964
I'll shout, "Ready, aim, fire"

1041
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,128
Ho, ho, ho, Henry Higgins

1042
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,086
Down you'll go, Henry Higgins

1043
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:24,837
Just you wait

1044
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,487
A.

1045
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:51,203
A.

1046
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:56,538
A.

1047
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,841
A.

1048
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:06,304
All right, Eliza, say it again.

1049
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:11,969
"The rain
in Spain stays mainly in the plain."

1050
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:17,233
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

1051
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:18,476
Didn't I say that?

1052
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,108
No, Eliza, you didn't "say" that.

1053
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,234
You didn't even say that.

1054
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,691
Every night before you get into bed,
where you used to say your prayers,

1055
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:30,493
I want you to say, "The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain,"

1056
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,160
50 times.

1057
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:37,118
You'll get much further with the Lord
if you learn not to offend his ears.

1058
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:39,711
Now for your H's.

1059
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,956
Pickering, this is going to be ghastly.

1060
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,129
Control yourself, Higgins.
Give the girl a chance.

1061
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:47,258
Oh, well, I suppose you can't
expect her to get it right the first time.

1062
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,046
Come here, Eliza, and watch closely.

1063
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:52,388
Now.

1064
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,766
You see that flame?

1065
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,265
Every time you pronounce
the letter H correctly,

1066
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,517
the flame will waver.

1067
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,519
And every time you drop your H,
the flame will remain stationary.

1068
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,772
That's how you'll know
if you've done it correctly.

1069
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:06,694
In time, your ear will hear
the difference.

1070
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,243
See it better in the mirror.

1071
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,816
Now, listen carefully.

1072
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:17,702
In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,
hurricanes hardly ever happen.

1073
01:05:18,456 --> 01:05:21,166
Now, repeat that after me.

1074
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,875
In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire
hurricanes hardly ever happen.

1075
01:05:25,087 --> 01:05:28,087
"In Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire,

1076
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,009
hurricanes hardly ever happen."

1077
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:31,377
Oh, no, no, no.

1078
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,554
Have you no ear at all?

1079
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,473
- Should I do it over?
- No, please.

1080
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:38,432
Start from the very beginning.
Just do this.

1081
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:43,523
Go: Ha, ha, ha.

1082
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:47,648
Ha, ha, ha.

1083
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,569
Go on, go on, go on.

1084
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,950
Ha, ha, ha.

1085
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:56,118
Does the same thing hold true
in India, Pickering?

1086
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:59,367
Is it truly a habit to them,
their dropping a letter like the letter H,

1087
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:03,210
using it where it doesn't belong,
like "hever" instead of "ever"?

1088
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:05,207
Why is it that Slavs,
when they learn English,

1089
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:06,959
have a tendency to do it with G's?

1090
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,803
- They say "linger" instead of "linger."
ELIZA: Ha, ha, ha.

1091
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:13,337
And then they turn right around
and say "singer" instead of "singer."

1092
01:06:13,552 --> 01:06:16,512
I've noticed the Slavs using it
where it isn't needed,

1093
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:19,432
they learn English,
they have to do it with their G's.

1094
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,074
The girl, Higgins.

1095
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,025
Go on, go on, go on.

1096
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,316
- Go on.
- Ha, ha, ha.

All day long

1103
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:54,224
On his feet

1104
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:58,637
Up and down until he's numb

1105
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:00,888
Doesn't rest

1106
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,060
Doesn't eat

1107
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:07,359
Doesn't touch a crumb

1108
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,441
Again, Eliza.

1109
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:15,412
How kind of you to let me come.

1110
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:18,414
How kind of you to let me come.

1111
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,617
No, kind of you. Kind of you.

1112
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:24,578
Kind.
How kind of you to let me come.

1113
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:27,670
- How kind of you to let me come.
- No, no.

1114
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,877
Kind of you. Kind of you.
It's like "cup of tea," kind of you.

1115
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:33,378
Cup of tea. Say "cup of tea."

1116
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:34,921
- Cup of tea.
- No, no.

1117
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,474
A cup of tea.

1118
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:41,138
It's awfully good cake, this.
I wonder where Mrs. Pearce gets it.

1119
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,472
Mm. First rate.

1120
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,353
And those strawberry tarts
are delicious.

1121
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:45,980
Did you try the plain cake?

1122
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:52,939
Try it again.

1123
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:56,032
- Did you try the--?
- Pickering!

1124
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,859
Again, Eliza.

1125
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,244
Cup of tea.

1126
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,830
Oh, no.

1127
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:02,325
Can't you hear the difference?

1128
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:04,496
Look, put your tongue forward

1129
01:08:04,705 --> 01:08:07,665
until it squeezes on the top
of your lower teeth.

1130
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:11,375
- And then say "cup."
- Cup.

1131
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,047
- Then say "of."
- Of.

1132
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,795
Then say, "cup, cup, cup, of, of, of."

1133
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:18,298
- Cup, cup, cup, of, of, of.
- Cup, cup, cup, of, of, of.

1134
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,591
Cup, cup-- Of, of--

1135

PICKERING: By Jove, Higgins,
that was a glorious tea.

1136

Why don't you finish
that last strawberry tart?

1137
01:08:24,517 --> 01:08:26,847
- I couldn't eat another thing.
- Oh, I couldn't touch it.

1138
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:29,063
- Shame to waste it.
- Oh, it won't be wasted.

1139
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:33,691
I know somebody who's immensely
fond of strawberry tarts.

1140
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:40,162

Five.

1154
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,985
Six marbles.

1155
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,947
Now, I want you to read this
and I want you to enunciate every word

1156
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:31,794
just as if the marbles
were not in your mouth.

1157
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:37,381
With blackest moss the flower-pots
Were thickly crusted, one and all

Each word clear as a bell.

01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:45,681
With blackest moss the flower-pots...

PICKERING: I say, Higgins,
are those pebbles really necessary?

If they were necessary

1163
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,519
they are necessary
for Eliza Doolittle.

What's the matter?

01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:34,435
I swallowed one.

Oh, it doesn't matter, I got plenty more.
Open your mouth.

Quit, Professor Higgins

1180
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:50,499
Hear our plea

1181
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:57,214
Or payday we will quit
Professor Higgins

1182
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,549
"A" not "I"

1183
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,835
"O" not "ow"

1184
01:11:02,049 --> 01:11:06,339
Pounding, pounding in our brain

1185
01:11:06,553 --> 01:11:08,553
"A" not "I"

1186
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:11,274
"O" not "ow"

1187
01:11:11,475 --> 01:11:14,265
Don't say "rine," say "rain"

1188
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,323
The rain in Spain

1189
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:24,856
stays mainly in the plain.

1190
01:11:25,072 --> 01:11:28,702
I can't. I'm so tired.

1191
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,539
I'm so tired.

1192
01:11:31,745 --> 01:11:35,155
For God's sake, Higgins,
it must be 3:00 in the morning.

1193
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,294
Do be reasonable.

1194
01:11:37,501 --> 01:11:40,751
I am always reasonable.

1195
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,094
Eliza,

1196
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:47,429
if I can go on
with a blistering headache, you can.

1197
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,966
I got a headache too.

1198
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,350
Oh, here.

1199
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,560
I know your head aches.
I know you're tired.

1200
01:11:56,770 --> 01:12:01,650
I know your nerves are as raw
as meat in a butcher's window.

1201
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:06,783
But think what you're trying
to accomplish.

1202
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:10,989
Just think what you're dealing with.

1203
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:14,405
The majesty and grandeur
of the English language,

1204
01:12:14,621 --> 01:12:17,711
it's the greatest possession we have.

1205
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:21,126
The noblest thoughts that ever flowed
through the hearts of men

1206
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,837
are contained
in its extraordinary, imaginative

1207
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:29,219
and musical mixtures of sounds.

1208
01:12:29,428 --> 01:12:33,888
And that's what you've set yourself out
to conquer, Eliza.

1209
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:38,693
And conquer it you will.

1210
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,550
Now, try it again.

1211
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:12,184
The rain in Spain

1212
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:18,058
stays mainly in the plain.

1213
01:13:18,894 --> 01:13:20,484
What was that?

1214
01:13:26,276 --> 01:13:29,316
The rain in Spain

1215
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:34,780
stays mainly in the plain.

1216
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:41,790
Again.

1217
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:48,458
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

1218
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:50,054
I think she's got it.

1219
01:13:50,259 --> 01:13:51,549
I think she's got it.

1220
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,760
The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1221
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:59,644
By George, she's got it
By George, she's got it

1222
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:03,312
Now once again
Where does it rain?

1223
01:14:03,522 --> 01:14:04,772
On the plain

1224
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,362
On the plain

1225
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:09,487
And where's that soggy plain?

1226
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:10,985
In Spain

1227
01:14:11,196 --> 01:14:12,696
In Spain

1228
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:17,406
ALL : The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1229
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:19,039
Bravo!

1230
01:14:19,246 --> 01:14:24,876
The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1231
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:29,009
In Hartford, Hereford
And Hampshire

1232
01:14:29,214 --> 01:14:32,304
Hurricanes hardly happen

1233
01:14:35,345 --> 01:14:37,925
How kind of you to let me come

1234
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:41,230
Now, once again
Where does it rain?

1235
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,725
On the plain

1236
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,516
On the plain

1237
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,610
And where's that blasted plain?

1238
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,106
In Spain

1239
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,608
In Spain

1240
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:55,239
The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1241
01:14:57,242 --> 01:15:01,662
The rain in Spain
Stays mainly in the plain

1242
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:07,082
Pickering. Pickering. Olé. Olé.

1243
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:12,553
Olé!

1244
01:15:23,977 --> 01:15:26,477
Hey, Pickering.

1245
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,612
HIGGINS:
Ho! Hey!

1246
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,740
ALL:
Olé!

1247
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:44,996
PICKERING:
Oh, dear.

1248
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:48,037
Oh, dear.

1249
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:49,792
We're making
fine progress, Pickering.

1250
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:52,593
I think the time has come
to try her out.

1251
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:56,008
- Are you feeling all right, Mr. Higgins?
- Yes, I'm feeling fine, Mrs. Pearce.

1252
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,928
- How are you?
- Very well, sir, thank you.

1253
01:15:58,136 --> 01:16:00,556
Let's test her in public
and see how she fares.

1254
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:04,484
Mr. Higgins, I was awakened
by a dreadful pounding.

1255
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,095
Do you know
what it might have been?

1256
01:16:06,311 --> 01:16:07,771
Pounding?
I didn't hear any pounding.

1257
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,610
- You do, Pickering?
- No.

1258
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:12,435
You know, if this goes on,
Mrs. Pearce, you'd better see a doctor.

1259
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,691
- I know. We'll take her to the races.
PICKERING: The races?

1260
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:18,613
- My mother's box at Ascot.
- You'll consult your mother first?

1261
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,454
Oh, yes, of course.

1262
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:25,785
No, I think I should better surprise her.
Now let's go to bed.

1263
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:28,708
First thing in the morning,
we'll go out and we'll buy her a dress.

1264
01:16:28,917 --> 01:16:30,587
Now get on with your work, Eliza.

1265
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,844
PEARCE: But, Mr. Higgins,
it's early in the morning.

1266
01:16:33,046 --> 01:16:35,916
What better time to work
than early in the morning?

1267
01:16:36,133 --> 01:16:39,343
- Where does one buy a lady's gown?
- Whitley's, of course.

1268
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:42,103
- How do you know that?
- Common knowledge.

1269
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:43,886
Let's not buy her
anything too flowery.

1270
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:48,599
I despise those gowns with
sort of weeds here and weeds there.

1271
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:51,812
I wanna buy something
sort of simple and modest and elegant,

1272
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:53,524
is what's called for.

1273
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:57,034
Perhaps with a bow.

1274
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,989
Yes, I think that's just right.

1275
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,533
You've all been working
much too hard.

1276
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,704
I think the strain
is beginning to show.

1277
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:08,002
Eliza, I don't care
what Mr. Higgins says,

1278
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:10,706
you must put down your books
and go to bed.

1279
01:17:10,917 --> 01:17:13,747
Bed, bed
I couldn't go to bed

1280
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:17,632
My head's too light
To try to set it down

1281
01:17:20,802 --> 01:17:23,852
Sleep, sleep
I couldn't sleep tonight

1282
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:29,726
Not for all the jewels in the crown

1283
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:33,113
I could have danced all night

1284
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,395
I could have danced all night

1285
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:42,620
And still have begged for more

1286
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:46,124
I could have spread my wings

1287
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:49,158
And done a thousand things

1288
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:53,883
I've never done before

1289
01:17:55,587 --> 01:18:02,007
I'll never know
What made it so exciting

1290
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:08,219
Why all at once
My heart took flight

1291
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:13,603
I only know when he

1292
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:17,322
Began to dance with me

1293
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:22,236
I could have danced
Danced, danced

1294
01:18:22,447 --> 01:18:26,237
All night

1295
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,128
SERVANT 1 :
It's after 3 now

1296
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:42,470
SERVANT 2 :
Don't you agree now

1297
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:46,546
- She ought to be in bed
- She ought to be in bed

1298
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,466
ELIZA: I could have danced
- You're tired out

1299
01:18:49,641 --> 01:18:50,981
ELIZA: All night
- You must be dead

1300
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,813
- I could have danced
- Your face is drawn

1301
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:54,229
- All night
- Your eyes are red

1302
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,608
- And still have
- Now say good night, please

1303
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,605
- Begged for more
- Turn out the light, please

1304
01:18:58,817 --> 01:19:00,527
It's really time for you to be in bed

1305
01:19:00,736 --> 01:19:02,446
- I could have spread
- Do come along

1306
01:19:02,612 --> 01:19:03,782
- My wings
- Do as you're told

1307
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:07,159
- And done a thousand things
- Or Mrs. Pearce is apt to scold

1308
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:09,327
- I've never
- You're up too late, miss

1309
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:11,246
- Done before
- And sure as fate, miss

1310
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:13,405
You'll catch a cold

1311
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:20,303
I'll never know
What made it so exciting

1312
01:19:20,505 --> 01:19:26,715
Why all at once
My heart took flight

1313
01:19:26,928 --> 01:19:30,808
- I only know
- Put down your book

1314
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,346
- When he
- The work will keep

1315
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:34,349
- Began to dance
- Now settle down

1316
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:35,691
- With me
- And go to sleep

1317
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:41,106
I could have danced
Danced, danced

1318
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,488
All night

1319
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:45,775
I understand, dear

1320
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:48,029
It's all been grand, dear

1321
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:52,371
But now it's time to sleep

1322
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:01,752
I could have danced all night

1323
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:05,173
I could have danced all night

1324
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:11,813
And still have begged for more

1325
01:20:12,015 --> 01:20:15,265
I could have spread my wings

1326
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,807
And done a thousand things

1327
01:20:19,022 --> 01:20:25,362
I've never done before

1328
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:31,950
I'll never know
What made it so exciting

1329
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:38,080
Why all at once
My heart took flight

1330
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:43,421
I only know when he

1331
01:20:43,630 --> 01:20:46,720
Began to dance with me

1332
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:51,965
I could have danced
Danced, danced

1333
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:58,440
All night

1334
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:41,401
ALL : Every duke and earl
And peer is here

1335
01:21:41,605 --> 01:21:45,475
Everyone who should be here
Is here

1336
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:49,402
What a smashing
Positively dashing spectacle

1337
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:53,413
The Ascot opening day

1338
01:21:53,617 --> 01:21:56,577
At the gate are all the horses

1339
01:21:56,786 --> 01:22:01,286
Waiting for the cue to fly away

1340
01:22:01,499 --> 01:22:04,379
What a gripping, absolutely ripping

1341
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:09,256
Moment at the Ascot opening day

1342
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:13,256
Pulses rushing

1343
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:16,970
Faces flushing

1344
01:22:17,182 --> 01:22:21,062
Heartbeats speed up

1345
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:25,149
I have never been so keyed up

1346
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:27,017
Any second now

1347
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:28,983
They'll begin to run

1348
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,694
Hark, a bell is ringing

1349
01:22:30,904 --> 01:22:33,824
They are springing forward
Look!

1350
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:37,532
It has begun

1351
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:06,612
What a frenzied moment that was

1352
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:11,105
Didn't they maintain
An exhausting pace?

1353
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:14,659
'Twas a thrilling, absolutely chilling

1354
01:23:14,864 --> 01:23:18,954
Running of the Ascot opening race

1355
01:24:36,362 --> 01:24:38,492
WOMAN 1:
Oh, no. No, it's true.

1356
01:24:38,698 --> 01:24:40,158
- This is the time.
MAN: Yeah.

1357
01:24:40,366 --> 01:24:41,946
WOMAN 2:
Yes.

1358
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:43,830
- Yes.
WOMAN 3: My daughter's...

1359
01:24:44,037 --> 01:24:45,497
WOMAN 4:
They've had enough time.

1360
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:46,995
What did you think of the race?

1361
01:24:47,207 --> 01:24:48,287
HIGGINS:
Mother.

1362
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:52,503
Henry. What a disagreeable surprise.

1363
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:54,302
Hello, Mother.

1364
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,376
- How nice you look.
- What are you doing here?

1365
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,881
You promised never to come to Ascot.
Go home at once.

1366
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:01,644
- I can't, I'm here on business.
- No, Henry, you must.

1367
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:03,806
Now, I'm quite serious.
You offend all my friends.

1368
01:25:04,015 --> 01:25:05,965
The moment they meet you,
I never see them again.

1369
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:07,734
Besides, you aren't dressed
for Ascot.

1370
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:08,976
I changed my shirt.

1371
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,647
Now, listen, Mother,
I've got a job for you, a phonetics job.

1372
01:25:11,856 --> 01:25:13,476
- I've picked up a girl.
- Henry.

1373
01:25:13,691 --> 01:25:16,151
Oh, no, darling, not a love affair.
She's a flower girl.

1374
01:25:16,361 --> 01:25:17,991
I'm taking her
to the annual Embassy Ball.

1375
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:20,406
- But I want to try her out first.
- I beg your pardon?

1376
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,405
- Well, you know the Embassy Ball.
- Of course, I know the ball, but--

1377
01:25:23,618 --> 01:25:25,948
So I invited her to your box today,
do you understand?

1378
01:25:26,162 --> 01:25:28,252
- Common flower girl?
- She'll be all right.

1379
01:25:28,456 --> 01:25:29,866
I taught her how to speak properly.

1380
01:25:30,083 --> 01:25:32,133
She has strict instructions
as to her behavior.

1381
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:33,585
She is to keep to two subjects.

1382
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,705
The weather and everybody's health.
"Fine day" and "How do you do?"

1383
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:38,723
Not to let herself go
on things in general.

1384
01:25:38,925 --> 01:25:40,715
Help her along, darling.
You'll be quite safe.

1385
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:43,217
Safe? To talk about one's health
in the middle of a race?

1386
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:45,309
Well, she's got to talk
about something.

1387
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,675
- Where is the girl now?
- She's being pinned.

1388
01:25:47,892 --> 01:25:49,942
Some of the clothes we bought her
didn't quite fit.

1389
01:25:50,145 --> 01:25:52,095
I told Pickering
we should have taken her with us.

1390
01:25:52,313 --> 01:25:54,773
EYNSFORD-HILL:
Thank goodness you're here.

1391
01:25:55,775 --> 01:25:59,815
MRS. HIGGINS: Mrs. Eynsford-Hill.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Higgins.

1392
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:01,359
You know my son, Henry.

1393
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:03,413
Oh, how do you do?

1394
01:26:03,616 --> 01:26:05,866
- I've seen you somewhere before.
- I don't know.

1395
01:26:06,077 --> 01:26:08,407
Oh, it doesn't matter.
You better sit down.

1396
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:14,169
- Lady Boxington.
- Where the devil can they be?

1397
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:15,957
- Lord Boxington.
- Ha!

1398
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,084
MRS. HIGGINS: Colonel Pickering,
you're just in time for tea.

1399
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:52,369
Thank you, Mrs. Higgins.

1400
01:26:52,582 --> 01:26:54,422
May I introduce Miss Eliza Doolittle?

1401
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:55,876
MRS. HIGGINS:
My dear, Miss Doolittle.

1402
01:26:56,085 --> 01:26:58,625
How kind of you to let me come.

1403
01:26:58,838 --> 01:27:01,048
MRS. HIGGINS:
Delighted, my dear.

1404
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:02,716
Lady Boxington.

1405
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,136
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1406
01:27:05,345 --> 01:27:06,385
Lord Boxington.

1407
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:08,346
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1408
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:10,096
Mrs. Eynsford-Hill, Miss Doolittle.

1409
01:27:10,308 --> 01:27:12,518
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1410
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:15,102
And Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1411
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:18,727
How do you do?

1412
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:22,154
How do you do?

1413
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:23,742
Miss Doolittle.

1414
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:27,867
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.

1415
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,996
The first race was very exciting,
Miss Doolittle.

1416
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:41,552
I'm so sorry that you missed it.

1417
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:43,466
Will it rain, do you think?

1418
01:27:43,716 --> 01:27:48,596
The rain in Spain
stays mainly in the plain.

1419
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:55,311
But in Hartford, Hereford
and Hampshire,

1420
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,400
hurricanes hardly ever happen.

1421
01:27:59,148 --> 01:28:00,398
How awfully funny.

1422
01:28:00,608 --> 01:28:03,818
What is wrong with that, young man?
I bet I got it right.

1423
01:28:04,028 --> 01:28:05,528
Smashing.

1424
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:08,568
Hasn't it suddenly turned chilly?

1425
01:28:08,783 --> 01:28:11,913
I do hope we won't have
any unseasonable cold spells.

1426
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,790
They bring on so much influenza.

1427
01:28:13,997 --> 01:28:16,957
And the whole of our family
is susceptible to it.

1428
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:19,876
My aunt died of influenza.

1429
01:28:20,086 --> 01:28:21,746
So they said.

1430
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:26,303
But it's my belief
they done the old woman in.

1431
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:28,638
MRS. HIGGINS:
Done her in?

1432
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:30,635
Yes, Lord love you.

1433
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:33,137
Why should she die of influenza

1434
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:37,189
when she come through diphtheria
right enough the year before?

1435
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:40,055
Fairly blue with it, she was.

1436
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:42,153
They all thought she was dead.

1437
01:28:42,358 --> 01:28:46,608
But my father, he kept ladling gin
down her throat.

1438
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,199
Then she come to so sudden,

1439
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:55,501
she bit the bowl off the spoon.

1440
01:28:56,956 --> 01:28:58,246
Dear me.

1441
01:28:59,792 --> 01:29:02,792
Now, what call would a woman
with that strength in her

1442
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,514
have to die of influenza?

1443
01:29:05,715 --> 01:29:10,755
What become of her new straw hat
that should have come to me?

1444
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:15,643
Somebody pinched it.

1445
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:18,229
And what I say is,

1446
01:29:18,436 --> 01:29:21,856
them that's pinched it done her in.

1447
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:25,435
Done her in?
Done her in, did you say?

1448
01:29:25,651 --> 01:29:27,491
Whatever does it mean?

1449
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,565
Oh, that's the new small talk.

1450
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:32,281
To do somebody in means
to kill them.

1451
01:29:32,492 --> 01:29:36,122
But you surely don't believe
your aunt was killed?

1452
01:29:36,329 --> 01:29:37,619
Do I not?

1453
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:43,130
Them she lived with would have
killed her for a hatpin, let alone a hat.

1454
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:46,046
But it can't have been right
for your father

1455
01:29:46,255 --> 01:29:48,505
to pour spirits down her throat
like that.

1456
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:50,586
It might have killed her.

1457
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:52,052
Not her.

1458
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:54,891
Gin was mother's milk to her.

1459
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:58,428
Besides, he poured so much down
his own throat,

1460
01:29:58,643 --> 01:30:00,443
he knew the good of it.

1461
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,475
Do you mean that he drank?

1462
01:30:02,688 --> 01:30:05,688
Drank, my word, something chronic.

1463
01:30:09,195 --> 01:30:12,605
Here, what are you sniggering at?

1464
01:30:12,824 --> 01:30:14,074
It's the new small talk.

1465
01:30:14,283 --> 01:30:16,413
You do it so awfully well.

1466
01:30:16,619 --> 01:30:20,749
Well, if I was doing it proper,
what was you sniggering at?

1467
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,997
Have I said anything I oughtn't?

1468
01:30:23,209 --> 01:30:25,039
HIGGINS:
Oh, no.

1469
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:26,803
Not at all, my dear.

1470
01:30:27,004 --> 01:30:29,264
Well, lots of mercy, anyhow.

1471
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,299
What I always say--

1472
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,300
I don't know whether there's time
before the next race to place a bet.

1473
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:37,723
- But come, my dear.
MRS. HIGGINS: I don't suppose so.

1474
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:39,272
I have a bet on Number 7.

1475
01:30:39,475 --> 01:30:41,265
I should be so happy
if you would take it.

1476
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:43,847
You'll enjoy the race
ever so much more.

1477
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:45,153
That's very kind of you.

1478
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:47,976
- His name is Dover.
PICKERING: Come along, my dear.

1479
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:55,241
ALL : There they are again
Lining up to run

1480
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:58,990
Now they're holding steady
They are ready for it

1481
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:04,213
Look, it has begun

1482
01:31:08,921 --> 01:31:09,961
Come on.

1483
01:31:10,173 --> 01:31:12,633
Come on, Dover. Come on.

1484
01:31:12,842 --> 01:31:14,682
Come on, Dover.

1485
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,546
Come on.

1486
01:31:20,057 --> 01:31:21,847
Come on, Dover!

1487
01:31:22,059 --> 01:31:24,269
Move your blooming ass!

1488
01:31:27,231 --> 01:31:30,111
MAN: Don't upset yourself, my dear.
WOMAN: Please.

1489
01:31:30,776 --> 01:31:32,566
Oh, my dear.

1490
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,500
You're not serious, Henry.

1491
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:50,841
You don't expect to take her
to the Embassy Ball?

1492
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,507
Don't you think she's ready for it?

1493
01:31:52,715 --> 01:31:55,005
Dear, Henry,
she's ready for a canal barge.

1494
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:57,298
Well, her language may need
a little refining, but--

1495
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:58,552
Oh, really, Henry.

1496
01:31:58,763 --> 01:32:01,013
If you cannot see how impossible
this whole project is,

1497
01:32:01,224 --> 01:32:02,974
then you must be absolutely potty
about her.

1498
01:32:03,184 --> 01:32:06,314
I advise you to give it up and not put
yourself and this girl through more.

1499
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:09,271
Give it up? It's the most fascinating
venture I've ever undertaken.

1500
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:12,572
Pickering and I are at it from morning
till night. It fills our whole lives.

1501
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:16,147
Teaching Eliza, talking to Eliza,
listening to Eliza, dressing Eliza.

1502
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:17,784
What?

1503
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:21,450
You're a pretty pair of babies
playing with your live doll.

1504
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:23,331
Here's the car.

1505
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:33,689
FREDDY:
I say, sir...

1506
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:45,200
Good evening, sir.

1507
01:33:45,411 --> 01:33:46,491
Dinner ready? I'm famished.

1508
01:33:46,704 --> 01:33:47,834
Immediately, sir.

1509
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:50,709
PEARCE:
Good evening, Professor Higgins.

1510
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:12,515
When she mentioned
How her aunt bit off the spoon

1511
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:16,440
She completely done me in

1512
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:20,531
And my heart went on a journey
To the moon

1513
01:34:20,738 --> 01:34:25,868
When she told about her father
And the gin

1514
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:30,577
And I never saw
A more enchanting farce

1515
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:35,000
Than the moment when she shouted:
"Move your blooming--"

1516
01:34:36,295 --> 01:34:38,375
- Yes, sir?
- Is Miss Doolittle in?

1517
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:41,339
- Whom shall I say is calling?
- Freddy Eynsford-Hill.

1518
01:34:41,550 --> 01:34:43,430
Oh, if she doesn't remember
who I am,

1519
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:46,596
tell her I'm the chap
who was sniggering at her.

1520
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:47,846
Yes, sir.

1521
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:50,097
- And will you give her these?
- Yes, sir.

1522
01:34:50,309 --> 01:34:51,479
Wouldn't you like to come in?

1523
01:34:51,644 --> 01:34:53,354
They're having dinner,
but you may wait.

1524
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:56,822
No. No, thank you. I want to
drink in the street where she lives.

1525
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:59,074
Yes, sir.

1526
01:35:05,574 --> 01:35:11,164
I have often walked
Down this street before

1527
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:16,792
But the pavement always stayed
Beneath my feet before

1528
01:35:17,002 --> 01:35:22,422
All at once am I
Several stories high

1529
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:28,353
Knowing I'm on the street
Where you live

1530
01:35:28,556 --> 01:35:34,096
Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?

1531
01:35:34,311 --> 01:35:39,821
Can you hear a lark
In any other part of town?

1532
01:35:40,025 --> 01:35:45,605
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?

1533
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:51,493
No, it's just on the street
Where you live

1534
01:35:51,954 --> 01:35:57,044
And, oh, the towering feeling

1535
01:35:57,251 --> 01:36:03,381
Just to know somehow you are near

1536
01:36:03,591 --> 01:36:08,391
The overpowering feeling

1537
01:36:08,596 --> 01:36:14,596
That any second
You may suddenly appear

1538
01:36:14,810 --> 01:36:20,440
People stop and stare
They don't bother me

1539
01:36:20,649 --> 01:36:26,359
For there's nowhere else on earth
That I would rather be

1540
01:36:26,572 --> 01:36:29,572
Let the time go by

1541
01:36:29,784 --> 01:36:35,834
I won't care if I can be here

1542
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:42,090
On the street where you live

1543
01:36:42,296 --> 01:36:43,546
PEARCE:
Oh, sir.

1544
01:36:46,675 --> 01:36:48,295
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

1545
01:36:48,511 --> 01:36:51,511
Miss Doolittle says she doesn't
want to see anyone ever again.

1546
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:54,892
- But why? She was unbelievable.
- So I've been told, sir.

1547
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:56,680
Is there any further message?

1548
01:36:56,894 --> 01:36:58,944
Yes. Tell her that I'll wait.

1549
01:36:59,146 --> 01:37:01,516
Oh, but it might be days, sir,
even weeks.

1550
01:37:01,732 --> 01:37:04,902
But don't you see?
I'll be happier here.

1551
01:37:13,202 --> 01:37:18,712
People stop and stare
They don't bother me

1552
01:37:19,124 --> 01:37:24,804
For there's nowhere else on earth
That I would rather be

1553
01:37:25,005 --> 01:37:28,125
Let the time go by

1554
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:35,432
I won't care if I can be here

1555
01:37:35,641 --> 01:37:43,481
On the street where you live

1556
01:37:48,737 --> 01:37:51,447
It really is, Higgins.
It's inhuman to continue.

1557
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:54,277
You realize what you've got
to teach this poor girl in six weeks?

1558
01:37:54,493 --> 01:37:55,873
Teach her to walk, talk,

1559
01:37:56,078 --> 01:37:58,118
address a duke, a lord,
a bishop, an ambassador.

1560
01:37:58,330 --> 01:38:00,290
It's absolutely impossible.

1561
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:03,839
Higgins, I'm trying to tell you
that I want to call off the bet.

1562
01:38:04,044 --> 01:38:06,254
I know you're a stubborn man,
but so am I.

1563
01:38:06,463 --> 01:38:08,133
This experiment is over.

1564
01:38:08,340 --> 01:38:10,550
And nothing
short of an order from the king

1565
01:38:10,759 --> 01:38:12,759
could force me to recant.

1566
01:38:12,970 --> 01:38:14,550
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1567
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:17,223
You understand, Higgins, it's over.

1568
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:18,683
Higgins.

1569
01:38:18,893 --> 01:38:21,483
Higgins, if there's any mishap
at the embassy tonight,

1570
01:38:21,687 --> 01:38:24,147
if Miss Doolittle suffers
any embarrassment whatever,

1571
01:38:24,356 --> 01:38:25,566
it'll be on your head alone.

1572
01:38:25,774 --> 01:38:26,864
Eliza can do anything.

1573
01:38:27,067 --> 01:38:28,687
Suppose she's discovered?
Remember Ascot.

1574
01:38:28,903 --> 01:38:30,653
Suppose she makes
another ghastly mistake?

1575
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:34,373
There will be no horses
at the ball, Pickering.

1576
01:38:35,659 --> 01:38:37,659
PICKERING:
Think how agonizing it would be.

1577
01:38:37,870 --> 01:38:40,620
Oh, if anything happened tonight,
I don't know what I'd do.

1578
01:38:40,831 --> 01:38:42,331
You could always
rejoin your regiment.

1579
01:38:42,541 --> 01:38:44,171
This is no time for flippancy,
Higgins.

1580
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:46,336
The way you've driven the girl
the last six weeks

1581
01:38:46,545 --> 01:38:48,665
has exceeded
all bounds of common decency.

1582
01:38:48,881 --> 01:38:50,471
For God's sake,
stop pacing up and down.

1583
01:38:50,674 --> 01:38:51,764
Can't you settle somewhere?

1584
01:38:51,967 --> 01:38:53,587
Have some port.
It'll quieten your nerves.

1585
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:56,182
I'm not nervous.

1586
01:38:56,722 --> 01:38:59,392
- Where is it?
- On the piano.

1587
01:39:00,517 --> 01:39:01,887
- The car is here, sir.
- Oh, good.

1588
01:39:02,102 --> 01:39:03,272
- Tell Miss Doolittle.
- Yes.

1589
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:06,809
Tell Miss Doolittle indeed. I bet you
that damned gown doesn't fit.

1590
01:39:07,024 --> 01:39:09,234
I warned you
about these French designers.

1591
01:39:09,443 --> 01:39:12,453
We should've gone to an English shop,
everyone would've been on our side.

1592
01:39:12,655 --> 01:39:14,655
- Have a glass of port?
- No, thank you.

1593
01:39:21,455 --> 01:39:25,285
Are you so sure this girl will retain
everything you've hammered into her?

1594
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:27,920
Well, we shall see.

1595
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,088
Suppose she doesn't?

1596
01:39:31,006 --> 01:39:32,546
I lose my bet.

1597
01:39:32,758 --> 01:39:34,798
Higgins, there's one thing
I can't stand about you,

1598
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:36,430
that's your
confounded complacency.

1599
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,507
At a moment like this,
with so much at stake,

1600
01:39:38,722 --> 01:39:41,812
it's utterly indecent
that you don't need a glass of port.

1601
01:39:43,727 --> 01:39:47,147
And what about the girl? You act
as though she doesn't matter at all.

1602
01:39:47,606 --> 01:39:50,396
Oh, rubbish, Pickering.
Of course she matters.

1603
01:39:50,609 --> 01:39:52,899
What do you think
I've been doing all these months?

1604
01:39:53,112 --> 01:39:56,412
What could possibly matter more
than to take a human being

1605
01:39:56,615 --> 01:39:58,315
and change her
into a different human being

1606
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,794
by creating a new speech for her?

1607
01:40:00,995 --> 01:40:02,245
It's filling up the deepest gap

1608
01:40:02,454 --> 01:40:06,924
that separates class from class
and soul from soul.

1609
01:40:07,126 --> 01:40:10,086
No, she matters immensely.

1610
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:34,110
Miss Doolittle, you look beautiful.

1611
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:36,398
Thank you, Colonel Pickering.

1612
01:40:36,572 --> 01:40:39,202
Don't you think so, Higgins?

1613
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:44,950
Not bad. Not bad at all.

1614
01:43:18,275 --> 01:43:21,235
BUTLER:
Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Deuvile.

1615
01:43:23,739 --> 01:43:27,949
Major General the right honorable
Sir James Clarence.

1616
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:31,954
Marquis and Marquise of Glenning.

1617
01:43:33,290 --> 01:43:36,790
Lady Suzanna De Longly.

1618
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:40,380
Sir Albert and Lady Derring.

1619
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:44,296
Honorable Mr. Archibald
and Lady Catherine Herring.

1620
01:43:44,509 --> 01:43:46,759
Maestro. Maestro.

1621
01:43:49,139 --> 01:43:52,059
- Don't you remember me?
- No. Who the devil are you?

1622
01:43:52,267 --> 01:43:53,267
I'm your pupil.

1623
01:43:53,477 --> 01:43:55,387
Your first, your greatest,
your best pupil.

1624
01:43:55,604 --> 01:43:58,064
I'm Zoltan Karpathy,
that marvelous boy.

1625
01:43:58,273 --> 01:43:59,483
Oh.

1626
01:43:59,691 --> 01:44:01,571
I made your name
famous throughout Europe.

1627
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:03,567
You teach me phonetics,
you cannot forget me.

1628
01:44:03,779 --> 01:44:05,529
Why don't you have your hair cut?

1629
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:07,319
I don't have
your imposing appearance,

1630
01:44:07,532 --> 01:44:08,572
your figure, your brow.

1631
01:44:08,784 --> 01:44:10,744
If I had my hair cut,
nobody would notice me.

1632
01:44:10,953 --> 01:44:12,663
Where did you get
all these old coins?

1633
01:44:12,871 --> 01:44:14,791
These are decorations
for language.

1634
01:44:14,998 --> 01:44:16,868
The queen of Transylvania
is here this evening.

1635
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:20,094
I'm indispensable to her
at these official international parties.

1636
01:44:20,295 --> 01:44:22,915
I speak 32 languages,
I know everyone in Europe.

1637
01:44:23,131 --> 01:44:25,171
No impostor
can escape my detection.

1638
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:27,934
Professor Karpathy.

1639
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:31,599
The Greek ambassador.

1640
01:44:31,807 --> 01:44:32,927
Greek my foot.

1641
01:44:33,141 --> 01:44:35,641
He pretends not to know any English,
but he cannot deceive me.

1642
01:44:35,852 --> 01:44:37,812
He's the son
of a Yorkshire watchmaker.

1643
01:44:39,273 --> 01:44:40,983
He speaks English so villainously

1644
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:44,651
that he cannot utter a word
without betraying his origin.

1645
01:44:44,861 --> 01:44:47,151
I help him pretend,
but I make him pay through the nose.

1646
01:44:47,364 --> 01:44:48,414
I make them all pay.

1647
01:44:48,615 --> 01:44:50,195
Excuse me, sir,
you are wanted upstairs.

1648
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:53,039
- Her Excellency asked for you.
- Oh, excuse me.

1649
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:13,675
BUTLER:
Viscount and Viscountess Saxon.

1650
01:45:17,060 --> 01:45:20,520
Baron and Baroness of Yorkshire.

1651
01:45:21,648 --> 01:45:25,148
Sir Guy and Lady Skot Ackland.

1652
01:45:44,254 --> 01:45:47,054
The Count and Countess Demerau.

1653
01:45:47,257 --> 01:45:49,797
The Viscount
and Viscountess Hillyard.

1654
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,850
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Lanser.

1655
01:45:53,388 --> 01:45:56,058
Lord and Lady Clanders.

1656
01:45:56,892 --> 01:45:59,692
Miss Eliza Doolittle,
Colonel Pickering.

1657
01:45:59,895 --> 01:46:03,515
Miss Eliza Doolittle,
Colonel Pickering.

1658
01:46:03,732 --> 01:46:06,112
- Professor Higgins.
- Good evening, Miss Doolittle.

1659
01:46:06,318 --> 01:46:07,358
Your Excellency.

1660
01:46:07,569 --> 01:46:09,699
- Miss Doolittle.
- How do you do?

1661
01:46:09,905 --> 01:46:12,315
- Good evening, colonel.
- Good evening.

1662
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:13,662
- Oh, colonel.
- What?

1663
01:46:13,825 --> 01:46:16,445
LADY: What an enchanting young
lady you have with you this evening.

1664
01:46:16,620 --> 01:46:18,200
PICKERING: Thank you.
- Well, who is she?

1665
01:46:18,372 --> 01:46:22,632
Oh, a cousin of mine. And Higgins.
Excuse me.

1666
01:46:22,834 --> 01:46:24,004
Professor Higgins.

1667
01:46:24,211 --> 01:46:28,511
Such a faraway look
as if she's always lived in a garden.

1668
01:46:28,715 --> 01:46:31,875
So she has, a sort of garden.

1669
01:46:48,318 --> 01:46:50,238
WOMAN 1:
Is that her son?

1670
01:46:52,906 --> 01:46:54,906
WOMAN 2:
I don't believe in...

1671
01:46:55,117 --> 01:46:57,117
WOMAN 3:
I shall die.

1672
01:46:59,830 --> 01:47:03,080
Henry must take Eliza home at once.
There's a language expert here.

1673
01:47:03,291 --> 01:47:05,421
Sort of, you know,
sort of impostorologist.

1674
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:07,207
I beg your pardon.

1675
01:47:07,421 --> 01:47:09,551
The young lady
with Colonel Pickering.

1676
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:11,666
Find out who she is.

1677
01:47:11,883 --> 01:47:13,133
With pleasure.

1678
01:47:13,343 --> 01:47:15,803
The whole situation
is highly explosive.

1679
01:47:18,515 --> 01:47:21,175
WOMAN 1:
We heard on the best authority.

1680
01:47:21,810 --> 01:47:24,150
Tell me, Zoltan, some more
about the Greek ambassador.

1681
01:47:24,354 --> 01:47:27,734
Gladly, but first I would love you
to present me to this glorious creature.

1682
01:47:27,941 --> 01:47:30,611
Does he really come
from Yorkshire?

1683
01:47:39,161 --> 01:47:42,081
BUTLER: Her Majesty,
the queen of Transylvania

1684
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:46,249
and his Royal Highness,
Prince Gregor.

1685
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:34,840
Charming. Quite charming.

1686
01:48:35,300 --> 01:48:37,510
Miss Doolittle, ma'am.

1687
01:49:01,368 --> 01:49:03,158
MAN:
Such a charming girl.

1688
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:06,500
WOMAN 1: We'll know
when we hear her announced.

1689
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:08,956
WOMAN 2:
That's a beautiful ball gown.

1690
01:49:16,758 --> 01:49:18,798
WOMAN 3:
Is that her son?

1691
01:50:13,231 --> 01:50:16,571
Miss Doolittle,
my son would like to dance with you.

1692
01:51:11,122 --> 01:51:12,872
Eliza?

1693
01:53:23,087 --> 01:53:25,957
PICKERING:
Absolutely fantastic.

1694
01:53:28,259 --> 01:53:29,589
HIGGINS:
A lot of tomfoolery.

1695
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,853
PICKERING:
It was an immense achievement.

1696
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:33,675
Well, Mr. Higgins?

1697
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:37,350
A triumph, Mrs. Pearce.
A total triumph.

1698
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:40,770
Higgins, you were superb.
Absolutely superb.

1699
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:43,690
Tell us the truth now, weren't
you a bit nervous once or twice?

1700
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:46,440
- Not for a second.
- Not during the whole evening?

1701
01:53:46,653 --> 01:53:48,113
I saw we were gonna win
hands down.

1702
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:50,531
I felt like a bear in a cage
with nothing to do.

1703
01:53:50,740 --> 01:53:52,120
It was an immense achievement.

1704
01:53:52,325 --> 01:53:55,235
If I hadn't backed myself to do it,
I'd have given it up two months ago.

1705
01:53:55,453 --> 01:53:58,413
- Absolutely fantastic.
- A lot of tomfoolery.

1706
01:53:58,623 --> 01:54:00,423
Higgins, I salute you.

1707
01:54:00,625 --> 01:54:03,335
Oh, silly people don't know
their own silly business.

1708
01:54:03,545 --> 01:54:06,585
Tonight, old man, you did it
You did it, you did it

1709
01:54:06,798 --> 01:54:09,508
You said that you would do it
And indeed you did

1710
01:54:09,717 --> 01:54:12,587
I thought that you would rue it
I doubted you'd do it

1711
01:54:12,804 --> 01:54:15,724
But now I must admit it
That succeed you did

1712
01:54:15,932 --> 01:54:18,432
You should get a medal
Or be even made a knight

1713
01:54:18,643 --> 01:54:21,813
Oh, it was nothing
Really nothing

1714
01:54:22,021 --> 01:54:24,731
All alone you hurdled
Every obstacle in sight

1715
01:54:24,941 --> 01:54:26,651
Now wait
Now wait

1716
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:31,360
Give credit where it's due
A lot of the glory goes to you

1717
01:54:31,573 --> 01:54:34,493
But you're the one who did it
Who did it, who did it

1718
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:37,451
As sturdy as Gibraltar
Not a second did you falter

1719
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:42,502
There's no doubt about it
You did it

1720
01:54:45,503 --> 01:54:49,723
I must have aged a year tonight
At times I thought I'd die of fright

1721
01:54:49,924 --> 01:54:52,974
Never was there a momentary lull

1722
01:54:53,803 --> 01:54:57,723
Shortly after we came in
I saw at once we'd easily win

1723
01:54:57,932 --> 01:55:00,642
And after that, I found it deadly dull

1724
01:55:01,895 --> 01:55:04,345
PICKERING: You should have heard
The "oohs" and "ahs"

1725
01:55:04,564 --> 01:55:06,024
Everyone wondering who she was

1726
01:55:06,232 --> 01:55:09,572
You'd think they'd never seen
A lady before

1727
01:55:09,777 --> 01:55:14,867
And when the prince of Transylvania
Asked to meet her

1728
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:19,754
And gave his arm
To lead her to the floor

1729
01:55:20,079 --> 01:55:23,249
I said to him
You did it, you did it, you did it

1730
01:55:23,458 --> 01:55:26,498
They thought she was ecstatic
And so damned aristocratic

1731
01:55:26,711 --> 01:55:31,881
And they never knew that you did it

1732
01:55:34,427 --> 01:55:36,087
Thank goodness
for Zoltan Karpathy.

1733
01:55:36,304 --> 01:55:38,564
If it hadn't been for him,
I would've died of boredom.

1734
01:55:38,765 --> 01:55:41,215
Karpathy? That dreadful Hungarian?
Was he there?

1735
01:55:41,434 --> 01:55:44,194
Yes, he was there, all right,
and up to his old tricks.

1736
01:55:44,395 --> 01:55:46,855
That blackguard
Who uses the science of speech

1737
01:55:47,065 --> 01:55:49,855
More to blackmail and swindle
Than teach

1738
01:55:50,068 --> 01:55:52,688
He made it
The devilish business of his

1739
01:55:52,904 --> 01:55:55,824
To find out who this Miss Doolittle is

1740
01:55:56,991 --> 01:55:59,371
Every time we looked around
There he was

1741
01:55:59,577 --> 01:56:01,827
That hairy hound from Budapest

1742
01:56:03,873 --> 01:56:05,213
Never leaving us alone

1743
01:56:05,416 --> 01:56:07,996
Never have I ever known
A ruder pest

1744
01:56:10,088 --> 01:56:11,958
Finally I decided it was foolish

1745
01:56:12,173 --> 01:56:14,843
Not to let him have
His chance with her

1746
01:56:16,177 --> 01:56:20,717
So I stepped aside
And let him dance with her

1747
01:56:22,100 --> 01:56:27,440
Oozing charm from every pore
He oiled his way around the floor

1748
01:56:27,647 --> 01:56:32,067
Every trick that he could play
He used to strip her mask away

1749
01:56:32,276 --> 01:56:33,936
And when at last
The dance was done

1750
01:56:34,153 --> 01:56:37,113
He glowed as if he knew he'd won

1751
01:56:37,323 --> 01:56:40,743
And with a voice too eager
And a smile too broad

1752
01:56:40,952 --> 01:56:44,622
He announced to the hostess
That she was a fraud

1753
01:56:45,248 --> 01:56:46,328
No.

1754
01:56:52,088 --> 01:56:53,798
"Her English is too good," he said

1755
01:56:53,965 --> 01:56:57,335
That clearly indicates
That she is foreign

1756
01:56:58,594 --> 01:57:01,224
Whereas others are instructed
In their native language

1757
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:03,141
English people aren't

1758
01:57:04,934 --> 01:57:06,274
And although she may have studied

1759
01:57:06,477 --> 01:57:09,767
With an expert dialectician
And grammarian

1760
01:57:11,691 --> 01:57:18,861
I can tell
That she was a born Hungarian

1761
01:57:20,575 --> 01:57:23,365
Not only Hungarian
But of royal blood

1762
01:57:24,203 --> 01:57:26,413
She is a princess

1763
01:57:26,622 --> 01:57:30,292
"Her blood," he said, "is bluer
Than the Danube is or ever was

1764
01:57:30,501 --> 01:57:33,421
Royalty is absolutely written
On her face

1765
01:57:33,629 --> 01:57:36,549
She thought that I was taken in
But actually I never was

1766
01:57:36,758 --> 01:57:39,468
How could she deceive
Another member of her race?"

1767
01:57:40,261 --> 01:57:44,811
"I know each language on the map,"
Said he

1768
01:57:45,016 --> 01:57:48,806
"And she's Hungarian
As the first 'Hungarian Rhapsody"'

1769
01:57:50,521 --> 01:57:51,981
SERVANTS :
Bravo

1770
01:57:52,190 --> 01:57:53,940
Bravo

1771
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:56,360
Bravo

1772
01:57:57,320 --> 01:58:01,360
Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1773
01:58:01,574 --> 01:58:05,084
For your glorious victory

1774
01:58:05,286 --> 01:58:09,246
Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1775
01:58:09,457 --> 01:58:13,457
You'll be mentioned in history

1776
01:58:13,669 --> 01:58:16,709
- This evening, sir, you did it
- Congratulations, Professor Higgins

1777
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:19,633
- You said that you would do it
- For your glorious victory

1778
01:58:19,842 --> 01:58:22,552
This evening, sir, you did it
You did it, you did it

1779
01:58:22,762 --> 01:58:24,812
We know that we have did it
But you did it

1780
01:58:25,014 --> 01:58:33,364
And the credit for it
All belongs to you

1781
01:58:35,525 --> 01:58:38,145
Well, thank God that's over.

1782
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:40,861
Now I can go to bed
without dreading tomorrow.

1783
01:58:43,366 --> 01:58:45,696
PEARCE: Good night, Mr. Higgins.
HIGGINS: Good night, Mrs. Pearce.

1784
01:58:45,910 --> 01:58:48,200
PICKERING: I think I'll turn in too.
Good night, Higgins.

1785
01:58:48,412 --> 01:58:49,962
It's been a great occasion.

1786
01:58:50,164 --> 01:58:51,794
Good night, Pickering.

1787
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:54,496
Oh, Mrs. Pearce?

1788
01:58:54,710 --> 01:58:56,090
Oh, damn.

1789
01:58:56,295 --> 01:58:59,255
I meant to ask her to give me coffee
in the morning instead of tea.

1790
01:58:59,465 --> 01:59:01,295
Leave a little note for her,
will you, Eliza?

1791
01:59:01,509 --> 01:59:03,469
And put out the lights.

1792
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:53,887
HIGGINS:
Left them downstairs. Oh, darn it.

1793
01:59:54,103 --> 01:59:56,233
Leave my head behind
one of these days.

1794
01:59:56,439 --> 01:59:58,819
What the devil have I done
with my slippers?

1795
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:03,780
Here are your slippers.

1796
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:05,700
There!

1797
02:00:06,115 --> 02:00:08,025
And there!

1798
02:00:08,242 --> 02:00:12,542
Take your slippers and may you never
have a day's luck with them.

1799
02:00:12,747 --> 02:00:16,117
What on earth?
What's the matter? Is anything wrong?

1800
02:00:16,626 --> 02:00:19,536
No, nothing wrong with you.
I won your bet for you, haven't I?

1801
02:00:19,754 --> 02:00:22,514
That's enough for you.
I don't matter, I suppose.

1802
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:26,086
You won my bet?
You presumptuous insect.

1803
02:00:26,302 --> 02:00:28,642
I won it. What did you throw
those slippers at me for?

1804
02:00:28,846 --> 02:00:31,806
Because I wanted to smash your face.
I could kill you, you selfish brute.

1805
02:00:32,016 --> 02:00:34,476
Why didn't you leave me
where you picked me up in the gutter?

1806
02:00:34,685 --> 02:00:37,725
You thank God it's all over now,
you can throw me back again there.

1807
02:00:38,189 --> 02:00:40,899
Oh, so the creature's nervous
after all.

1808
02:00:44,403 --> 02:00:46,613
Claws in, you cat. How dare you
show your temper to me.

1809
02:00:46,822 --> 02:00:47,912
Sit down and be quiet.

1810
02:00:48,115 --> 02:00:53,325
Oh, what's to become of me?
What's to become of me?

1811
02:00:54,580 --> 02:00:57,540
How do I know what's to become
of you? What does it matter?

1812
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:01,500
You don't care. I know you don't care.
You wouldn't care if I was dead.

1813
02:01:01,712 --> 02:01:04,882
I'm nothing to you.
Not as much as them slippers.

1814
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:07,431
- Those slippers.
- Those slippers.

1815
02:01:07,635 --> 02:01:10,425
I didn't think
it meant any difference now.

1816
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:15,979
Why have you suddenly begun
going on like this?

1817
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:18,725
May I ask if you complain
of your treatment here?

1818
02:01:18,938 --> 02:01:19,978
No.

1819
02:01:20,189 --> 02:01:22,939
Has anybody behaved badly?
Colonel Pickering, Mrs. Pearce?

1820
02:01:23,150 --> 02:01:24,280
No.

1821
02:01:24,485 --> 02:01:28,145
Well, you don't pretend
that I have treated you badly?

1822
02:01:28,572 --> 02:01:32,202
- No.
- No. I'm glad to hear that.

1823
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:35,750
Perhaps you're tired
after the strain of the day.

1824
02:01:35,955 --> 02:01:38,535
Would you have a chocolate?

1825
02:01:38,749 --> 02:01:40,419
No!

1826
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:41,706
Thank you.

1827
02:01:43,337 --> 02:01:45,667
Well, it's only natural
that you should be anxious,

1828
02:01:45,881 --> 02:01:47,221
but it's all over now.

1829
02:01:47,425 --> 02:01:49,175
Nothing more to worry about.

1830
02:01:49,385 --> 02:01:53,215
No, nothing more for you
to worry about.

1831
02:01:53,597 --> 02:01:56,727
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

1832
02:01:56,934 --> 02:02:00,194
Why? In heaven's name, why?

1833
02:02:00,396 --> 02:02:04,226
Now, listen to me, Eliza.
All this irritation is purely subjective.

1834
02:02:04,442 --> 02:02:06,612
I don't understand. I'm too ignorant.

1835
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:10,199
It's just imagination.
Nothing's wrong. Nobody's hurting you.

1836
02:02:10,406 --> 02:02:13,776
Now, you go to bed and sleep it off.
Have a little cry and say your prayers

1837
02:02:13,993 --> 02:02:16,333
and you'll feel
very much more comfortable.

1838
02:02:16,537 --> 02:02:20,117
I heard your prayers,
"Thank God it's all over."

1839
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:21,923
Well, don't you thank God
it's all over

1840
02:02:22,126 --> 02:02:24,416
and how you're free
and you can do what you like.

1841
02:02:24,628 --> 02:02:28,008
Oh, what am I fit for?
What have you left me fit for?

1842
02:02:28,466 --> 02:02:31,676
Where am I to go?
What am I to do?

1843
02:02:31,886 --> 02:02:34,846
And what's to become of me?

1844
02:02:35,056 --> 02:02:39,136
Oh, that's what's worrying you, is it?

1845
02:02:39,518 --> 02:02:41,308
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that
if I were you.

1846
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:42,980
I'm sure you won't have
any difficulty

1847
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:45,649
in settling yourself
somewhere or other.

1848
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:51,284
I didn't quite realize
you were going away.

1849
02:02:52,448 --> 02:02:54,528
You might marry, you know.

1850
02:02:54,742 --> 02:02:57,372
You see, Eliza, all men
are not confirmed old bachelors

1851
02:02:57,578 --> 02:02:58,658
like me and the colonel.

1852
02:02:58,871 --> 02:03:02,251
Most men are the marrying sort,
poor devils.

1853
02:03:02,458 --> 02:03:03,538
And you're not bad-looking.

1854
02:03:03,751 --> 02:03:06,171
You're really quite a pleasure
to look at sometimes.

1855
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:09,419
Well, not now. When you've been
crying you look like the very devil.

1856
02:03:09,632 --> 02:03:11,722
But I mean when you're all right
and quite yourself,

1857
02:03:11,926 --> 02:03:15,676
you're what I would call attractive.

1858
02:03:16,055 --> 02:03:17,845
Now, you go to bed,
have a good night's rest,

1859
02:03:18,057 --> 02:03:19,637
then get up
and have a look at yourself.

1860
02:03:19,850 --> 02:03:22,060
You won't feel so bad.

1861
02:03:26,774 --> 02:03:30,404
I daresay my mother might find some
fellow or other who'd do very well.

1862
02:03:30,611 --> 02:03:32,651
We were above that
at Covent Garden.

1863
02:03:32,863 --> 02:03:34,283
What do you mean?

1864
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:37,620
I sold flowers, I didn't sell myself.

1865
02:03:37,827 --> 02:03:41,117
Now, you've made a lady of me,
I'm not fit to sell anything else.

1866
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:43,540
Oh, tosh, Eliza,
don't insult human relations

1867
02:03:43,749 --> 02:03:46,749
by dragging all that cant about buying
and selling into it.

1868
02:03:46,961 --> 02:03:48,801
You don't have to marry
if you don't want to.

1869
02:03:49,004 --> 02:03:52,474
- What else am I to do?
- Well, there are lots of things.

1870
02:03:52,675 --> 02:03:55,005
What about the old idea
of a florist shop?

1871
02:03:55,219 --> 02:03:58,139
Pickering would set you up in one.
He's got lots of money.

1872
02:03:58,347 --> 02:04:00,427
He paid for all those togs
you're wearing tonight.

1873
02:04:00,641 --> 02:04:04,481
And that with the hire of the jewelry
will make a big hole in 200 pounds.

1874
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:07,187
Oh, come on now.
You'll be all right.

1875
02:04:08,190 --> 02:04:11,690
Well, I must be off to bed.
I'm really devilish sleepy.

1876
02:04:12,736 --> 02:04:14,736
I was looking for something.
What was it?

1877
02:04:14,947 --> 02:04:16,067
Your slippers.

1878
02:04:16,824 --> 02:04:20,494
Oh, yes, of course.
You shied them at me.

1879
02:04:20,703 --> 02:04:24,873
- Before you go, sir,
- Hm?

1880
02:04:26,709 --> 02:04:29,919
do my clothes belong to me
or to Colonel Pickering?

1881
02:04:31,046 --> 02:04:32,876
What the devil use
would they be to Pickering?

1882
02:04:33,090 --> 02:04:34,800
Why do you bother about that
in the night?

1883
02:04:35,009 --> 02:04:36,759
I want to know
what I may take away with me.

1884
02:04:36,969 --> 02:04:38,849
I don't wanna be
accused of stealing.

1885
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:41,925
Stealing?

1886
02:04:42,141 --> 02:04:45,231
You shouldn't have said that, Eliza.
That shows a want of feeling.

1887
02:04:45,436 --> 02:04:49,436
I'm sorry. I'm a common ignorant girl.
In my station, I have to be careful.

1888
02:04:49,648 --> 02:04:52,648
There can't be any feelings between
the likes of you and the likes of me.

1889
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:55,860
Please, will you tell me
what belongs to me and what doesn't?

1890
02:04:57,031 --> 02:04:59,451
Take the whole damned houseful
if you want.

1891
02:04:59,658 --> 02:05:01,988
Except the jewelry, that's hired.
Will that satisfy you?

1892
02:05:02,203 --> 02:05:03,453
Stop, please.

1893
02:05:05,915 --> 02:05:09,455
Will you take these to your room
and keep them safe?

1894
02:05:09,668 --> 02:05:12,048
I don't want to run the risk
of them being missed.

1895
02:05:14,173 --> 02:05:15,553
Hand them over.

1896
02:05:15,758 --> 02:05:17,548
If these belonged to me
and not the jeweler,

1897
02:05:17,760 --> 02:05:20,470
I'd ram them
down your ungrateful throat.

1898
02:05:20,679 --> 02:05:25,809
The ring isn't the jeweler's.
It's the one you bought me in Brighton.

1899
02:05:26,018 --> 02:05:28,188
I don't want it now.

1900
02:05:30,856 --> 02:05:32,766
Don't you hit me!

1901
02:05:32,983 --> 02:05:36,113
Hit you? You infamous creature,
how dare you suggest such a thing.

1902
02:05:36,320 --> 02:05:38,950
It's you who've hit me.
You've wounded me to the heart.

1903
02:05:39,156 --> 02:05:43,236
I'm glad.
I've got a little of my own back anyhow.

1904
02:05:43,911 --> 02:05:45,291
You've caused me
to lose my temper,

1905
02:05:45,496 --> 02:05:47,286
a thing that's hardly
happened to me before.

1906
02:05:47,498 --> 02:05:49,998
I don't wish to discuss it
further tonight. I'm going to bed.

1907
02:05:50,209 --> 02:05:52,839
You better leave your own note
for Mrs. Pearce about the coffee

1908
02:05:53,045 --> 02:05:54,585
for it won't be done by me.

1909
02:05:54,797 --> 02:05:59,377
Damn Mrs. Pearce,
damn the coffee and damn you.

1910
02:05:59,593 --> 02:06:01,223
And damn my own folly
for having lavished

1911
02:06:01,428 --> 02:06:04,058
my hard-earned knowledge
and the treasure of my regard

1912
02:06:04,265 --> 02:06:08,095
and intimacy
on a heartless guttersnipe.

1913
02:06:58,235 --> 02:07:03,355
Just you wait, Henry Higgins
Just you wait

1914
02:07:04,825 --> 02:07:09,285
You'll be sorry
But your tears'll be too late

1915
02:07:11,081 --> 02:07:14,131
You will be the one it's done to

1916
02:07:14,752 --> 02:07:18,252
And you'll have no one to run to

1917
02:07:18,672 --> 02:07:20,512
Just you wait

1918
02:07:48,786 --> 02:07:54,076
I have often walked
Down this street before

1919
02:07:54,583 --> 02:07:59,923
But the pavement always stayed
Beneath my feet before

1920
02:08:00,381 --> 02:08:06,011
All at once am I
Several stories high

1921
02:08:06,220 --> 02:08:11,970
Knowing I'm on the street
Where you live

1922
02:08:12,184 --> 02:08:17,814
Are there lilac trees
In the heart of town?

1923
02:08:18,023 --> 02:08:23,823
Can you hear a lark
In any other part of town?

1924
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:29,619
Does enchantment pour
Out of every door?

1925
02:08:29,827 --> 02:08:35,827
No, it's just on the street
Where you live

1926
02:08:36,041 --> 02:08:41,421
And, oh, the towering feeling

1927
02:08:41,630 --> 02:08:47,550
Just to know somehow you are near

1928
02:08:48,178 --> 02:08:52,808
The overpowering feeling

1929
02:08:53,016 --> 02:08:59,186
That any second
You may suddenly appear

1930
02:08:59,398 --> 02:09:02,228
People stop and stare

1931
02:09:02,443 --> 02:09:04,193
They don't...

1932
02:09:09,408 --> 02:09:10,988
Darling.

1933
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:13,490
Freddy,
whatever are you doing here?

1934
02:09:13,704 --> 02:09:15,754
Nothing.
I spend most of my nights here.

1935
02:09:15,956 --> 02:09:19,166
It's the only place where I'm happy.
Don't laugh at me, Miss Doolittle.

1936
02:09:19,376 --> 02:09:21,336
Don't you call me Miss Doolittle,
do you hear?

1937
02:09:21,545 --> 02:09:24,375
Eliza's good enough for me.

1938
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:28,970
Oh, Freddy, you don't think
I'm a heartless guttersnipe, do you?

1939
02:09:29,178 --> 02:09:32,218
Darling, how could you imagine
such a thing? You know how I feel.

1940
02:09:32,431 --> 02:09:35,311
I've written two or three times a day
telling you. Sheet and sheets.

1941
02:09:35,809 --> 02:09:39,349
Speak
And the world is full of singing

1942
02:09:39,563 --> 02:09:44,653
And I am winging
Higher than the birds

1943
02:09:44,860 --> 02:09:48,610
Touch
And my heart begins to crumble

1944
02:09:48,822 --> 02:09:52,582
The heavens tumble
Darling, and I'm--

1945
02:09:52,785 --> 02:09:55,745
Words, words, words
I'm so sick of words

1946
02:09:55,954 --> 02:09:58,964
I get words all day through
First from him, now from you

1947
02:09:59,166 --> 02:10:03,706
Is that all you blighters can do?

1948
02:10:03,921 --> 02:10:07,131
Don't talk of stars burning above

1949
02:10:07,341 --> 02:10:10,431
If you're in love, show me

1950
02:10:10,636 --> 02:10:12,426
Tell me no dreams

1951
02:10:12,638 --> 02:10:13,848
Filled with desire

1952
02:10:14,056 --> 02:10:16,766
If you're on fire, show me

1953
02:10:16,975 --> 02:10:19,515
Here we are together
In the middle of the night

1954
02:10:19,728 --> 02:10:23,558
Don't talk of spring
Just hold me tight

1955
02:10:23,774 --> 02:10:25,784
Anyone who's ever been in love
Will tell you that

1956
02:10:26,235 --> 02:10:28,985
This is no time for a chat

1957
02:10:30,447 --> 02:10:33,567
Haven't your lips
Longed for my touch?

1958
02:10:33,784 --> 02:10:38,624
Don't say how much
Show me, show me

1959
02:10:38,831 --> 02:10:41,961
Don't talk of love
Lasting through time

1960
02:10:42,167 --> 02:10:45,337
Make me no undying vow

1961
02:10:45,546 --> 02:10:51,046
Show me now

1962
02:10:52,177 --> 02:10:55,217
Sing me no song
Read me no rhyme

1963
02:10:55,430 --> 02:10:59,100
Don't waste my time
Show me

1964
02:10:59,309 --> 02:11:02,139
Don't talk of June
Don't talk of fall

1965
02:11:02,354 --> 02:11:03,774
Don't talk at all

1966
02:11:03,981 --> 02:11:05,611
Show me

1967
02:11:05,816 --> 02:11:07,936
Never do I ever
Want to hear another word

1968
02:11:08,151 --> 02:11:12,201
There isn't one I haven't heard

1969
02:11:12,406 --> 02:11:14,696
Here we are together
In what ought to be a dream

1970
02:11:14,908 --> 02:11:18,948
Say one more word and I'll scream

1971
02:11:19,162 --> 02:11:22,462
Haven't your arms
Hungered for mine?

1972
02:11:22,666 --> 02:11:24,326
Please don't explain

1973
02:11:24,543 --> 02:11:25,673
Show me

1974
02:11:25,878 --> 02:11:27,208
Show me

1975
02:11:27,671 --> 02:11:30,841
Don't wait until
Wrinkles and lines

1976
02:11:31,049 --> 02:11:34,259
Pop out all over my brow

1977
02:11:34,469 --> 02:11:41,269
Show me now

1978
02:11:43,228 --> 02:11:45,018
- Eliza, where are you going?
- To the river.

1979
02:11:45,230 --> 02:11:47,690
- What for?
- To make a hole in it.

1980
02:11:48,692 --> 02:11:51,192
Eliza, darling, what do you mean?

1981
02:12:00,412 --> 02:12:01,502
Taxi.

1982
02:12:01,705 --> 02:12:02,955
FREDDY:
Taxi.

1983
02:12:03,165 --> 02:12:04,205
But I've no money.

1984
02:12:04,416 --> 02:12:05,456
ELIZA:
I have.

1985
02:12:05,667 --> 02:12:08,627
FREDDY: Where are we going?
- Where I belong.

1986
02:12:22,476 --> 02:12:25,266
Darling, shall I come with you?

1987
02:12:51,213 --> 02:12:54,473
MAN :
With one enormous chair

1988
02:12:54,675 --> 02:13:00,095
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

1989
02:13:00,305 --> 02:13:04,975
CHORUS:
Lots of chocolate for me to eat

1990
02:13:05,185 --> 02:13:09,645
Lots of coal making lots of heat

1991
02:13:10,816 --> 02:13:14,316
Warm face, warm hands, warm feet

1992
02:13:14,528 --> 02:13:19,368
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

1993
02:13:20,075 --> 02:13:21,655
Oh, so...

1994
02:13:21,868 --> 02:13:24,538
Buy a flower, miss?

1995
02:13:24,746 --> 02:13:26,406
Yes, please.

1996
02:13:30,002 --> 02:13:33,962
CHORUS:
I would never budge

1997
02:13:34,172 --> 02:13:39,592
Till spring crept over me windowsill

1998
02:13:39,803 --> 02:13:44,143
Someone's head
Resting on my knee

1999
02:13:44,349 --> 02:13:48,889
Warm and tender as she can be

2000
02:13:49,104 --> 02:13:52,404
Who takes good care of me

2001
02:13:52,607 --> 02:14:01,277
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

2002
02:14:02,242 --> 02:14:06,162
Oh, good morning, miss.
Can I help you?

2003
02:14:08,540 --> 02:14:10,540
Do you mind if I warm my hands?

2004
02:14:10,751 --> 02:14:12,881
Go right ahead, miss.

2005
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:21,590
- Yes?
- Oh, excuse me, miss.

2006
02:14:21,803 --> 02:14:23,643
For a second I thought
you were somebody else.

2007
02:14:23,847 --> 02:14:25,427
Who?

2008
02:14:25,640 --> 02:14:26,680
Forgive me, ma'am.

2009
02:14:26,892 --> 02:14:29,022
Early morning light playing tricks
with my eyes.

2010
02:14:29,227 --> 02:14:30,517
Can I get you a taxi, ma'am?

2011
02:14:30,729 --> 02:14:32,349
A lady like you
shouldn't be walking alone

2012
02:14:32,564 --> 02:14:34,734
around London
this hour of the morning.

2013
02:14:36,359 --> 02:14:38,359
No, thank you.

2014
02:14:47,245 --> 02:14:51,365
ELIZA : Someone's head
Resting on my knee

2015
02:14:51,583 --> 02:14:56,343
Warm and tender as he can be

2016
02:14:56,546 --> 02:14:59,626
Who takes good care of me

2017
02:14:59,841 --> 02:15:07,471
Oh, wouldn't it be loverly?

2018
02:15:07,682 --> 02:15:12,942
Loverly, loverly

2019
02:15:13,146 --> 02:15:19,936
Loverly, loverly

2020
02:15:20,153 --> 02:15:21,533
MAN 1:
Goodbye, Alfie.

2021
02:15:21,738 --> 02:15:24,028
MAN 2: Goodbye.
MAN 3: I'll call you Mr. Doolittle now.

2022
02:15:24,241 --> 02:15:26,161
MAN 4:
Do come again, Mr. Doolittle.

2023
02:15:26,368 --> 02:15:28,658
We value your patronage always.

2024
02:15:28,870 --> 02:15:30,330
Oh, thank you, my good man.
Thank you.

2025
02:15:30,539 --> 02:15:32,249
Here. Come here.

2026
02:15:32,457 --> 02:15:34,747
Take the missus on a trip to Brighton
with my compliments.

2027
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:37,630
MAN 4:
Thank you, Mr. Doolittle.

2028
02:15:38,421 --> 02:15:41,971
Charming spot this, Harry.
We must visit it more often.

2029
02:15:42,425 --> 02:15:43,625
Father?

2030
02:15:45,595 --> 02:15:47,135
Oh, no.

2031
02:15:47,347 --> 02:15:49,007
You see, Harry, he has no mercy.

2032
02:15:49,224 --> 02:15:51,774
Sent her down to spy on me
in me misery, he did.

2033
02:15:51,977 --> 02:15:54,647
Me own flesh and blood.

2034
02:15:56,273 --> 02:15:59,283
Well, I'm miserable all right.
You can tell him that straight.

2035
02:15:59,484 --> 02:16:02,074
What are you talking about?
What you dressed up for?

2036
02:16:02,279 --> 02:16:03,529
As if you didn't know.

2037
02:16:03,738 --> 02:16:06,068
Go on back
to that Wimpole Street devil.

2038
02:16:06,283 --> 02:16:07,743
Tell him what he's done to me.

2039
02:16:07,951 --> 02:16:09,661
What's he done to you?

2040
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:11,120
Ruined me, that's all.

2041
02:16:11,329 --> 02:16:15,289
Tied me up and delivered me
into the hands of middle-class morality.

2042
02:16:15,500 --> 02:16:16,830
And don't you defend him.

2043
02:16:17,043 --> 02:16:18,593
Was it him or was it not him

2044
02:16:18,795 --> 02:16:21,415
wrote to an old American blighter
named Wallingford

2045
02:16:21,631 --> 02:16:26,051
who was giving 5 millions
to fund moral reform societies

2046
02:16:26,261 --> 02:16:28,681
to tell him the most original moralist
in England

2047
02:16:28,889 --> 02:16:32,599
was Mr. Alfred P. Doolittle,
a common dustman.

2048
02:16:34,102 --> 02:16:36,022
Sounds like one of his jokes.

2049
02:16:36,229 --> 02:16:39,479
You may call it a joke.
It's put the lid on me proper.

2050
02:16:39,691 --> 02:16:42,691
The old bloke died and left me
4000 pounds a year

2051
02:16:42,903 --> 02:16:44,993
in his blooming will.

2052
02:16:45,405 --> 02:16:47,355
Who asked him
to make a gentleman out of me?

2053
02:16:47,574 --> 02:16:49,834
I was happy, I was free.

2054
02:16:50,035 --> 02:16:52,325
I touched pretty nigh everyone
for money when I wanted it,

2055
02:16:52,537 --> 02:16:54,157
same as I touched him.

2056
02:16:54,372 --> 02:16:58,462
Now I'm tied neck and heels
and everybody touches me.

2057
02:16:58,668 --> 02:17:02,128
A year ago,
I hadn't a relation in the world

2058
02:17:02,339 --> 02:17:04,259
except one or two
who wouldn't speak to me.

2059
02:17:04,466 --> 02:17:05,586
Now I've 50.

2060
02:17:05,800 --> 02:17:08,550
Not a decent week's wages
amongst the lot of them.

2061
02:17:08,762 --> 02:17:11,812
Oh, I have to live for others now,
not for myself.

2062
02:17:12,015 --> 02:17:13,925
Middle-class morality.

2063
02:17:14,142 --> 02:17:17,392
Come on, Alfie. Another couple
of hours, we have to be at the church.

2064
02:17:17,604 --> 02:17:20,484
- Church?
- Yeah, church.

2065
02:17:20,690 --> 02:17:22,980
The deepest cut of all.

2066
02:17:23,193 --> 02:17:26,653
Well, why do you think I'm dressed up
like a ruddy pallbearer?

2067
02:17:26,863 --> 02:17:28,663
Your stepmother
wants to marry me.

2068
02:17:28,865 --> 02:17:31,775
Now I'm respectable,
she wants to be respectable.

2069
02:17:31,993 --> 02:17:35,253
Well, if that's the way you feel about it,
why don't you give the money back?

2070
02:17:35,455 --> 02:17:37,575
That's the tragedy of it, Eliza.

2071
02:17:37,791 --> 02:17:42,461
It's easy to say chuck it,
but I haven't the nerve.

2072
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:43,711
We're all intimidated.

2073
02:17:43,922 --> 02:17:46,222
That's what we are, intimidated.
Bought up.

2074
02:17:46,424 --> 02:17:48,594
Yeah. That's what I am.

2075
02:17:48,802 --> 02:17:51,512
That's what your precious professor's
brought me to.

2076
02:17:51,721 --> 02:17:54,101
Not my precious professor.

2077
02:17:54,307 --> 02:17:57,267
Oh, sent you back, has he?

2078
02:17:57,686 --> 02:18:00,266
First he shoves me
in the middle class,

2079
02:18:00,480 --> 02:18:03,230
then he chucks you out
for me to support you.

2080
02:18:03,441 --> 02:18:05,731
That's all part of his plan.

2081
02:18:05,944 --> 02:18:08,364
But you double-cross him.

2082
02:18:08,571 --> 02:18:10,661
Don't you come back home to me.

2083
02:18:10,865 --> 02:18:13,075
Don't you take tuppence from me.

2084
02:18:13,285 --> 02:18:16,825
You stand on your own two feet.
You're a lady now, and you can do it.

2085
02:18:17,038 --> 02:18:20,368
Yeah, that's right, Eliza.
You're a lady now.

2086
02:18:20,583 --> 02:18:22,503
Eliza, it's getting awfully cold
in that taxi.

2087
02:18:22,711 --> 02:18:26,761
Here, Eliza, would you like to come
and see me turned off this morning?

2088
02:18:26,965 --> 02:18:29,545
St. George's Hanover Square,
10:00.

2089
02:18:29,759 --> 02:18:31,509
I wouldn't advise it,
but you're welcome.

2090
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:34,220
- No, thank you, Dad.
- No.

2091
02:18:34,431 --> 02:18:36,971
Are you all finished here, Eliza?

2092
02:18:37,183 --> 02:18:38,813
Yes, Freddy.

2093
02:18:39,019 --> 02:18:41,189
I'm all finished here.

2094
02:18:44,065 --> 02:18:45,645
Good luck, Dad.

2095
02:18:45,859 --> 02:18:47,989
Thank you, Eliza.

2096
02:19:04,878 --> 02:19:07,958
- Come along, Alfie.
- How much time have I got left?

2097
02:19:08,173 --> 02:19:11,053
There's just a few more hours

2098
02:19:11,259 --> 02:19:13,509
That's all the time you've got

2099
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:18,890
A few more hours
Before they tie the knot

2100
02:19:19,642 --> 02:19:22,812
There's drinks and girls
All over London

2101
02:19:23,021 --> 02:19:27,321
And I gotta track 'em down
In just a few more hours

2102
02:19:27,525 --> 02:19:29,685
Set 'em up, me darlin'

2103
02:19:29,903 --> 02:19:33,863
I'm gettin' married in the mornin'

2104

The bells are gonna chime

2105

But get me to the church on time

2111
02:19:59,224 --> 02:20:02,774
But get me to the church on time

2112
02:20:03,103 --> 02:20:06,863

- Pickering.
- What's the matter?

2184
02:25:14,622 --> 02:25:16,252
Here's a confounded thing.
Eliza's bolted.

2185
02:25:16,457 --> 02:25:17,497
- Bolted?
- Bolted.

2186
02:25:17,709 --> 02:25:19,839
Last night, Mrs. Pearce let her go
without telling me.

2187
02:25:20,044 --> 02:25:21,504
- Well, I'm dashed.
- What am I to do?

2188
02:25:21,713 --> 02:25:24,173
I got tea instead of coffee.
I don't know where anything is.

2189
02:25:24,382 --> 02:25:26,432
- I don't know my appointments.
- Eliza would know.

2190
02:25:26,634 --> 02:25:28,094
Of course she'd know,
but she's gone.

2191
02:25:28,302 --> 02:25:29,932
Did either of you
frighten her last night?

2192
02:25:30,138 --> 02:25:31,968
We hardly said a word to her.
You were there.

2193
02:25:32,181 --> 02:25:33,641
Did you bully her
after I went to bed?

2194
02:25:33,850 --> 02:25:35,890
The other way around.
She threw the slippers at me.

2195
02:25:36,102 --> 02:25:37,812
I never gave her
the slightest provocation.

2196
02:25:38,020 --> 02:25:40,440
The slippers came, bang, at my head
before I uttered a word.

2197
02:25:40,648 --> 02:25:42,608
Used the most disgraceful language.
I was shocked.

2198
02:25:42,817 --> 02:25:44,437
- Well, I'm dashed.
- I don't understand.

2199
02:25:44,652 --> 02:25:46,152
We've given her every consideration.

2200
02:25:46,362 --> 02:25:48,162
- She admitted it herself.
- Well, I'm dashed.

2201
02:25:48,364 --> 02:25:50,994
Oh, Pickering, for God's sake,
stop being dashed and do something.

2202
02:25:51,200 --> 02:25:52,490
- What?
- Well, phone the police.

2203
02:25:52,702 --> 02:25:54,332
What are they
there for in heaven's name?

2204
02:25:54,537 --> 02:25:56,657
Mr. Higgins, you can't give
Eliza's name to the police

2205
02:25:56,873 --> 02:25:58,873
as if she were a thief
or a lost umbrella.

2206
02:25:59,083 --> 02:26:00,833
But why not? I want to find the girl.

2207
02:26:01,043 --> 02:26:03,883
She belongs to me.
I paid 5 pounds for her.

2208
02:26:04,088 --> 02:26:06,878
Quite right. Hello.
Scotland Yard, please.

2209
02:26:07,091 --> 02:26:08,551
Get me some coffee,
would you please?

2210
02:26:08,760 --> 02:26:09,970
- Yes, sir.
MAN: Who's there?

2211
02:26:10,178 --> 02:26:13,468
Scotland Yard? Yes, of course.
I beg your pardon, yes.

2212
02:26:13,681 --> 02:26:17,181
This is Colonel Pickering speaking.
Hugh Pickering.

2213
02:26:17,393 --> 02:26:20,603
- 27A Wimpole Street.
- 27A Wimpole Street.

2214
02:26:20,813 --> 02:26:23,523
- I want to report a missing person.
- Male or female?

2215
02:26:23,733 --> 02:26:27,193
A Miss Eliza Doolittle, yeah.
About 21.

2216
02:26:27,403 --> 02:26:29,453
And her height?

2217
02:26:29,655 --> 02:26:32,695
- I should say about 5'7".
- What color eyes?

2218
02:26:32,909 --> 02:26:36,999
Her eyes? Oh, let me think now.
Her eyes, her eyes.

2219
02:26:37,205 --> 02:26:39,785
- Brown.
- Brown, yeah.

2220
02:26:39,999 --> 02:26:42,879
No, no, no. Her hair?

2221
02:26:43,085 --> 02:26:44,285
Oh, good Lord. Let me...

2222
02:26:44,504 --> 02:26:46,214
Well, sort of nondescript
neutral sort of--

2223
02:26:46,422 --> 02:26:48,052
Brown, brown, brown.

2224
02:26:48,257 --> 02:26:50,757
You heard what he said?
Brown, brown, brown, yes.

2225
02:26:50,968 --> 02:26:52,338
No, no, no, this is her residence.

2226
02:26:52,553 --> 02:26:54,553
27A-- Yeah.

2227
02:26:54,764 --> 02:26:57,774
About between 3 and 4 this morning,
I understand.

2228
02:26:57,975 --> 02:26:59,515
Yes. No, no, no.

2229
02:26:59,727 --> 02:27:01,517
Rela-- No, she's no relation, no.

2230
02:27:01,729 --> 02:27:05,729
What? Well, just let's call her
a good friend, shall we?

2231
02:27:05,942 --> 02:27:07,322
I beg your pardon?

2232
02:27:07,527 --> 02:27:10,317
Listen to me, my man,
I don't like the tenor of that question.

2233
02:27:10,530 --> 02:27:13,780
What the girl does here is our affair.

2234
02:27:13,991 --> 02:27:17,911
Your affair is to get her back
so that she can continue doing it.

2235
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:19,830
Well, I'm dashed.

2236
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:25,090
What, in all in heaven,
Can have prompted her to go?

2237
02:27:25,294 --> 02:27:28,094
After such a triumph at the ball?

2238
02:27:28,297 --> 02:27:30,877
What could have depressed her?
What could have possessed her?

2239
02:27:31,092 --> 02:27:34,642
I cannot understand
The wretch at all

2240
02:27:36,097 --> 02:27:38,887
Higgins, I have an old school chum
at the Home Office.

2241
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:42,270
Perhaps he can help.
Think I'll give him a ring.

2242
02:27:42,478 --> 02:27:44,018
WOMAN :
Number, please.

2243
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:46,400
Whitehall 72-double 4, please.

2244
02:27:46,607 --> 02:27:48,897
Whitehall 72-double 4.

2245
02:27:49,110 --> 02:27:51,610
Women are irrational
That's all there is to that

2246
02:27:51,821 --> 02:27:54,661
Their heads are full of cotton
Hay and rags

2247
02:27:54,866 --> 02:27:57,776
They're nothing but exasperating
Irritating, vacillating

2248
02:27:57,994 --> 02:28:02,004
Calculating, agitating, maddening
And infuriating hags

2249
02:28:02,206 --> 02:28:03,286
MAN:
The Home Office here.

2250
02:28:03,499 --> 02:28:06,039
Oh, I want to speak
to Mr. Brewster Budgin, please.

2251
02:28:06,252 --> 02:28:09,672
- Would you hold on, sir?
- Brew-- Yes, I'll wait.

2252
02:28:14,135 --> 02:28:15,585
Pickering,

2253
02:28:15,803 --> 02:28:18,723
why can't a woman
be more like a man?

2254
02:28:18,931 --> 02:28:20,391
I beg your pardon?

2255
02:28:20,600 --> 02:28:24,560
Yes, why can't a woman
Be more like a man?

2256
02:28:24,770 --> 02:28:27,690
Men are so honest
So thoroughly square

2257
02:28:27,899 --> 02:28:31,109
Eternally noble, historically fair

2258
02:28:31,319 --> 02:28:34,399
Who, when you win
Will always give your back a pat

2259
02:28:34,614 --> 02:28:37,994
Well, why can't a woman
Be like that?

2260
02:28:38,451 --> 02:28:41,661
Why does everyone
Do what the others do?

2261
02:28:41,871 --> 02:28:44,661
Can't a woman learn
To use her head?

2262
02:28:45,333 --> 02:28:47,963
Why do they do everything
Their mothers do?

2263
02:28:48,169 --> 02:28:51,459
Why don't they grow up
Well, like their father instead?

2264
02:28:51,672 --> 02:28:54,672
Why can't a woman
Take after a man?

2265
02:28:54,884 --> 02:28:58,014
Men are so pleasant
So easy to please

2266
02:28:58,220 --> 02:29:01,310
Whenever you're with them
You're always at ease

2267
02:29:01,515 --> 02:29:03,805
Would you be slighted
If I didn't speak for hours?

2268
02:29:04,018 --> 02:29:05,058
Of course not.

2269
02:29:05,269 --> 02:29:06,979
Would you be livid
If I had a drink or two?

2270
02:29:07,188 --> 02:29:08,228
Nonsense.

2271
02:29:08,439 --> 02:29:10,399
Would you be wounded
If I never sent you flowers?

2272
02:29:10,608 --> 02:29:11,648
Never.

2273
02:29:11,859 --> 02:29:14,279
Well, why can't a woman
Be like you?

2274
02:29:15,321 --> 02:29:17,861
One man in a million
May shout a bit

2275
02:29:18,658 --> 02:29:21,368
Now and then
There's one with slight defects

2276
02:29:22,078 --> 02:29:24,408
One, perhaps, whose truthfulness
You doubt a bit

2277
02:29:24,622 --> 02:29:28,382
But by and large
We are a marvelous sex

2278
02:29:28,584 --> 02:29:31,544
Why can't a woman
Take after a man?

2279
02:29:31,754 --> 02:29:34,764
Because men are so friendly
Good-natured and kind

2280
02:29:34,966 --> 02:29:37,926
A better companion
You never will find

2281
02:29:38,469 --> 02:29:40,889
If I were hours late for dinner
Would you bellow?

2282
02:29:41,097 --> 02:29:42,137
Of course not.

2283
02:29:42,348 --> 02:29:44,308
If I forgot your silly birthday
Would you fuss?

2284
02:29:44,517 --> 02:29:45,557
Nonsense.

2285
02:29:45,768 --> 02:29:47,688
Would you complain
If I took out another fellow?

2286
02:29:47,895 --> 02:29:48,935
Never.

2287
02:29:49,146 --> 02:29:51,226
Well, why can't a woman
Be like us?

2288
02:29:53,901 --> 02:29:55,781
Oh, hello.
Mr. Brewster Budgin there?

2289
02:29:55,987 --> 02:29:58,357
- Yes, Budgin here.
- Bruzzie.

2290
02:29:58,572 --> 02:30:01,072
Oh, Bruzzie, you'll never
never guess who this is.

2291
02:30:01,283 --> 02:30:02,703
Oh, don't be silly. It's Pickering.

2292
02:30:02,910 --> 02:30:04,830
You're quite right, yes, it is.
Good heavens.

2293
02:30:05,037 --> 02:30:07,497
By George, what a memory.

2294
02:30:07,707 --> 02:30:09,207
How are you, Bruzzie?

2295
02:30:09,417 --> 02:30:11,327
Nice to hear your voice.

2296
02:30:11,544 --> 02:30:14,884
What? Oh, don't say that.
Is it already 30 years? Good heavens.

2297
02:30:15,089 --> 02:30:16,969
You're quite right.
Yes, oceans of water.

2298
02:30:17,174 --> 02:30:18,974
Listen, Bruzzie,
I'll tell you why I rang up.

2299
02:30:19,176 --> 02:30:22,426
Something rather unpleasant's
happened. Could I come and see you?

2300
02:30:22,638 --> 02:30:24,558
Well, I could.
Yes, now, straight away.

2301
02:30:24,765 --> 02:30:26,215
Right-o, good. Thank you, thank you.

2302
02:30:26,434 --> 02:30:28,694
Goodbye, Bruzzie.
Thank you very much.

2303
02:30:35,568 --> 02:30:38,858
Oh, Mrs. Pearce,
I'm going along to the Home Office.

2304
02:30:39,071 --> 02:30:41,281
Oh, I do hope you find her,
Colonel Pickering.

2305
02:30:41,490 --> 02:30:43,160
Mr. Higgins will miss her.

2306
02:30:43,367 --> 02:30:44,827
Mr. Higgins will miss her, eh?

2307
02:30:45,036 --> 02:30:48,246
Blast Mr. Higgins. I'll miss her.

2308
02:30:49,665 --> 02:30:51,205
HIGGINS:
Pickering?

2309
02:30:53,335 --> 02:30:55,125
Pickering?

2310
02:30:59,050 --> 02:31:00,430
Oh, Mrs. Pearce?

2311
02:31:00,634 --> 02:31:02,514
PEARCE: Yes, sir?
- Where's the colonel?

2312
02:31:02,720 --> 02:31:04,300
He's gone to the Home Office, sir.

2313
02:31:05,473 --> 02:31:06,933
Oh, there you are.

2314
02:31:07,141 --> 02:31:12,271
I'm disturbed and he runs for help.
Now, there's a good fellow.

2315
02:31:12,646 --> 02:31:16,106
Mrs. Pearce, you're a woman.

2316
02:31:16,317 --> 02:31:19,817
Why can't a woman
Be more like a man?

2317
02:31:20,029 --> 02:31:23,069
Men are so decent
Such regular chaps

2318
02:31:23,282 --> 02:31:26,282
Ready to help you
Through any mishaps

2319
02:31:26,494 --> 02:31:29,504
Ready to buck you up
Whenever you are glum

2320
02:31:29,705 --> 02:31:32,825
Why can't a woman be a chum?

2321
02:31:33,667 --> 02:31:36,247
Why is thinking
Something women never do?

2322
02:31:37,046 --> 02:31:39,796
Why is logic never even tried?

2323
02:31:40,257 --> 02:31:43,087
Straightening up their hair
Is all they ever do

2324
02:31:43,302 --> 02:31:46,642
Why don't they straighten up
The mess that's inside?

2325
02:31:46,847 --> 02:31:49,637
Why can't a woman
Behave like a man?

2326
02:31:50,142 --> 02:31:53,192
If I was a woman
Who'd been to a ball

2327
02:31:53,395 --> 02:31:56,435
Been hailed as a princess
By one and by all

2328
02:31:56,649 --> 02:31:59,609
Would I start weeping
Like a bathtub overflowing?

2329
02:31:59,819 --> 02:32:02,739
Or carry on
As if my home were in a tree?

2330
02:32:02,947 --> 02:32:05,617
Would I run off
And never tell me where I'm going?

2331
02:32:06,200 --> 02:32:09,700
Why can't a woman be like me?

2332
02:32:13,457 --> 02:32:15,077
Do you mean to say
that after you'd done

2333
02:32:15,292 --> 02:32:17,792
this wonderful thing for them
without making a single mistake,

2334
02:32:18,003 --> 02:32:19,963
they just sat there,
never said a word to you?

2335
02:32:20,172 --> 02:32:23,762
Never petted you, or admired you,
or told you how splendid you'd been?

2336
02:32:23,968 --> 02:32:27,008
Not a word. They just sat there
congratulating each other

2337
02:32:27,221 --> 02:32:28,471
on how marvelous they'd been.

2338
02:32:28,681 --> 02:32:32,271
How glad they were it was all over
and what a bore it had all been.

2339
02:32:32,476 --> 02:32:33,686
This is simply appalling.

2340
02:32:33,894 --> 02:32:35,654
I should not have thrown
my slippers at him,

2341
02:32:35,855 --> 02:32:37,685
I should've thrown the fire irons.

2342
02:32:37,898 --> 02:32:39,268
HIGGINS: Oh, is mother in?
- What's that?

2343
02:32:39,483 --> 02:32:40,783
Henry.

2344
02:32:40,985 --> 02:32:43,525
I knew it wouldn't be too long.

2345
02:32:43,737 --> 02:32:45,697
Now, remember,

2346
02:32:45,906 --> 02:32:47,986
you not only danced
with a prince last night,

2347
02:32:48,200 --> 02:32:51,040
you behaved like a princess.

2348
02:32:57,084 --> 02:33:00,174
Mother, the most confounded thing.
Do you...?

2349
02:33:03,340 --> 02:33:04,510
You?

2350
02:33:05,134 --> 02:33:08,014
Good afternoon, Professor Higgins.
Are you quite well?

2351
02:33:09,221 --> 02:33:10,811
- Am I--?
- Of course you are.

2352
02:33:11,015 --> 02:33:14,385
You are never ill.
Would you care for some tea?

2353
02:33:14,602 --> 02:33:17,562
Don't you dare try that game on me.
I taught it to you.

2354
02:33:17,771 --> 02:33:19,691
Now, get up and come home
and stop being a fool.

2355
02:33:19,899 --> 02:33:21,189
You've caused me enough trouble.

2356
02:33:21,400 --> 02:33:23,030
Very nicely put indeed, Henry.

2357
02:33:23,235 --> 02:33:24,985
No woman could resist
such an invitation.

2358
02:33:25,196 --> 02:33:27,156
How did this baggage get here
in the first place?

2359
02:33:27,364 --> 02:33:29,994
Eliza came to see me this morning
and I was delighted to have her.

2360
02:33:30,201 --> 02:33:32,741
And if you don't promise to behave,
I must ask you to leave.

2361
02:33:32,953 --> 02:33:34,873
You mean to say I'm to put on
my Sunday manners

2362
02:33:35,080 --> 02:33:37,710
for this thing that I created
out of the squashed cabbage leaves

2363
02:33:37,917 --> 02:33:38,957
of Covent Garden?

2364
02:33:39,126 --> 02:33:40,286
That's precisely what I mean.

2365
02:33:40,502 --> 02:33:42,172
Well, I'll see her damned first.

2366
02:33:42,379 --> 02:33:45,299
However did you learn good manners
with my son around?

2367
02:33:45,507 --> 02:33:47,337
It was very difficult.

2368
02:33:47,551 --> 02:33:49,931
I should never have known
how ladies and gentlemen behave

2369
02:33:50,137 --> 02:33:52,847
if it hadn't been
for Colonel Pickering.

2370
02:33:54,141 --> 02:33:56,271
He always showed me
that he felt and thought about me

2371
02:33:56,477 --> 02:33:59,847
as if I were something better
than a common flower girl.

2372
02:34:02,441 --> 02:34:06,241
You see, Mrs. Higgins,
apart from the things one can pick up,

2373
02:34:06,445 --> 02:34:08,315
the difference between a lady
and a flower girl

2374
02:34:08,530 --> 02:34:11,370
is not how she behaves,
but how she is treated.

2375
02:34:14,787 --> 02:34:16,867
I shall always be a flower girl
to Professor Higgins

2376
02:34:17,081 --> 02:34:20,041
because he always treats me
as a flower girl and always will.

2377
02:34:21,460 --> 02:34:24,130
But I know I shall always be a lady
to Colonel Pickering

2378
02:34:24,338 --> 02:34:27,628
because he always treats me
as a lady and always will.

2379
02:34:32,012 --> 02:34:33,392
Henry, don't grind your teeth.

2380
02:34:33,597 --> 02:34:36,217
The bishop is here, madam.
Shall I show him into the garden?

2381
02:34:36,433 --> 02:34:38,853
The bishop and the professor?
Good heavens, no.

2382
02:34:39,061 --> 02:34:43,651
I should be excommunicated.
I'll see him in the library.

2383
02:34:43,857 --> 02:34:46,477
Eliza, if my son
starts breaking up things,

2384
02:34:46,694 --> 02:34:49,244
I give you full permission
to have him evicted.

2385
02:34:49,446 --> 02:34:52,316
Henry, dear, I suggest you stick
to two subjects:

2386
02:34:52,533 --> 02:34:54,873
The weather and your health.

2387
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:23,770
Well, you've had a bit
of your own back, as you call it.

2388
02:35:23,981 --> 02:35:26,111
Have you had enough
and are you going to be reasonable

2389
02:35:26,317 --> 02:35:27,357
or do you want any more?

2390
02:35:27,568 --> 02:35:29,358
You want me back
only to pick up your slippers

2391
02:35:29,570 --> 02:35:32,160
and put up with your tempers
and fetch and carry for you.

2392
02:35:32,364 --> 02:35:34,494
- I didn't say I wanted you back at all.
- Oh, indeed?

2393
02:35:34,700 --> 02:35:37,450
- Then what are we talking about?
- Well, about you, not about me.

2394
02:35:37,661 --> 02:35:40,291
If you come back, you'll be treated
as you've always been treated.

2395
02:35:40,497 --> 02:35:42,957
I can't change my nature.
I don't intend to change my manners.

2396
02:35:43,167 --> 02:35:45,377
My manners are exactly the same
as Colonel Pickering's.

2397
02:35:45,586 --> 02:35:46,626
That's not true.

2398
02:35:46,837 --> 02:35:49,207
He treats a flower girl
as if she were a duchess.

2399
02:35:49,423 --> 02:35:51,513
Well, I treat a duchess
as if she was a flower girl.

2400
02:35:51,717 --> 02:35:53,047
Oh, I see. The same to everybody.

2401
02:35:53,260 --> 02:35:54,340
Just so.

2402
02:35:54,553 --> 02:35:57,263
You see, the great secret, Eliza,
is not a question of good manners

2403
02:35:57,473 --> 02:36:00,933
or bad manners
or any particular sort of manners,

2404
02:36:01,143 --> 02:36:06,233
but having the same manner
for all human souls.

2405
02:36:06,440 --> 02:36:08,650
The question is not
whether I treat you rudely,

2406
02:36:08,859 --> 02:36:12,199
whether you've ever heard me
treat anyone else better.

2407
02:36:12,404 --> 02:36:14,454
I don't care how you treat me.

2408
02:36:14,656 --> 02:36:16,066
I don't mind your swearing at me.

2409
02:36:16,283 --> 02:36:18,583
I shouldn't mind a black eye.
I've had one before this.

2410
02:36:18,786 --> 02:36:20,656
But I won't be passed over.

2411
02:36:20,871 --> 02:36:23,081
Well, then get out of my way,
for I won't stop for you.

2412
02:36:23,290 --> 02:36:25,080
You talk about me
as though I was a motor bus.

2413
02:36:25,292 --> 02:36:26,332
So you are a motor bus.

2414
02:36:26,543 --> 02:36:29,383
All bounce and go
and no consideration for anybody.

2415
02:36:29,588 --> 02:36:32,338
But I can get along without you.
Don't you think I can't.

2416
02:36:32,549 --> 02:36:35,339
I know you can. I told you you could.

2417
02:36:38,222 --> 02:36:43,102
You've never wondered, I suppose
whether I could get along without you.

2418
02:36:44,478 --> 02:36:46,598
Don't you try to get around me.

2419
02:36:46,814 --> 02:36:47,944
You'll have to.

2420
02:36:48,690 --> 02:36:52,070
So I can, without you
or any soul on earth.

2421
02:36:54,530 --> 02:36:56,240
I shall miss you, Eliza.

2422
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:59,158
I've learned something
from your idiotic notions.

2423
02:36:59,368 --> 02:37:02,408
I confess that, humbly and gratefully.

2424
02:37:04,915 --> 02:37:07,205
Well, you have my voice
on your gramophone.

2425
02:37:07,418 --> 02:37:09,748
When you feel lonely without me,
you can turn it on.

2426
02:37:09,962 --> 02:37:11,502
It has no feelings to hurt.

2427
02:37:13,424 --> 02:37:16,764
Well, I can't turn your soul on.

2428
02:37:18,929 --> 02:37:21,759
Ooh. You are a devil.

2429
02:37:21,974 --> 02:37:24,434
You can twist the heart in a girl
just as easily

2430
02:37:24,643 --> 02:37:26,983
as someone can twist her arms
to hurt her.

2431
02:37:27,187 --> 02:37:28,937
What am I to come back for?

2432
02:37:29,148 --> 02:37:31,318
For the fun of it.
That's why I took you on.

2433
02:37:31,525 --> 02:37:34,485
And you may throw me out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want me to.

2434
02:37:34,695 --> 02:37:37,735
Yes, and you may walk out tomorrow
if I don't do everything you want me to.

2435
02:37:37,948 --> 02:37:38,988
And live with my father?

2436
02:37:39,199 --> 02:37:41,489
Yes, or sell flowers.
Or would you rather marry Pickering?

2437
02:37:41,702 --> 02:37:43,162
I wouldn't marry you
if you asked me,

2438
02:37:43,370 --> 02:37:45,000
and you're nearer my age
than what he is.

2439
02:37:45,205 --> 02:37:46,905
- Than he is.
- I'll talk as I like.

2440
02:37:47,124 --> 02:37:48,674
You're not my teacher now.

2441
02:37:48,876 --> 02:37:51,626
That's not what I want,
and you don't think it is.

2442
02:37:51,837 --> 02:37:53,877
I've always had chaps enough
wanting me that way.

2443
02:37:54,089 --> 02:37:56,169
Freddy Hill writes me twice
and three times a day.

2444
02:37:56,383 --> 02:37:57,843
Sheets and sheets.

2445
02:37:58,051 --> 02:38:00,511
In short, you want me to be
as infatuated about you as he is.

2446
02:38:00,721 --> 02:38:02,641
- Is that it?
- No, I don't.

2447
02:38:02,848 --> 02:38:06,228
That's not the sort of feeling
I want from you.

2448
02:38:06,435 --> 02:38:08,595
I want a little kindness.

2449
02:38:08,812 --> 02:38:11,942
I know I'm a common ignorant girl
and you're a book-learned gentleman.

2450
02:38:12,149 --> 02:38:14,689
But I'm not dirt under your feet.

2451
02:38:14,902 --> 02:38:16,322
What I done--

2452
02:38:16,528 --> 02:38:20,068
What I did
was not for the taxis and the dresses,

2453
02:38:20,282 --> 02:38:23,532
but because we were
pleasant together and I've come to--

2454
02:38:23,744 --> 02:38:27,124
Came to care for you.

2455
02:38:27,331 --> 02:38:28,711
Not to want you to make love to me

2456
02:38:28,916 --> 02:38:30,706
and not forgetting
the difference between us,

2457
02:38:30,918 --> 02:38:34,418
but more friendly-like.

2458
02:38:36,048 --> 02:38:38,718
Well, of course. That's how I feel.

2459
02:38:38,926 --> 02:38:41,586
And how Pickering feels.

2460
02:38:41,803 --> 02:38:44,013
- Eliza, you're a fool.
- That's not the proper answer.

2461
02:38:44,223 --> 02:38:46,183
It's the only answer
till you stop being an idiot.

2462
02:38:46,391 --> 02:38:48,351
If you're a lady,
give up feeling neglected

2463
02:38:48,560 --> 02:38:50,440
if the men you know
don't spend half their time

2464
02:38:50,646 --> 02:38:53,106
sniveling over you and the other half
giving you black eyes.

2465
02:38:53,315 --> 02:38:55,725
You find me cold, unfeeling,
selfish, don't you?

2466
02:38:55,943 --> 02:38:57,823
Be off with you
to the sort of people you like.

2467
02:38:58,028 --> 02:38:59,818
Marry some sentimental hog
with lots of money

2468
02:39:00,030 --> 02:39:03,070
and a thick pair of lips to kiss you
and a thick pair of boots to kick you.

2469
02:39:03,283 --> 02:39:06,293
If you can't appreciate what you've got,
get what you can appreciate.

2470
02:39:06,495 --> 02:39:07,655
Oh, I can't talk to you.

2471
02:39:07,871 --> 02:39:11,121
You always turn everything
against me. I'm always in the wrong.

2472
02:39:11,333 --> 02:39:13,463
But don't be too sure
that you have me under your feet

2473
02:39:13,669 --> 02:39:15,339
to be trampled on and talked down.

2474
02:39:15,546 --> 02:39:18,376
I'll marry, Freddy, I will,
soon as I'm able to support him.

2475
02:39:19,383 --> 02:39:20,843
Freddy?

2476
02:39:21,051 --> 02:39:23,261
That poor devil who couldn't get a job
as an errand boy

2477
02:39:23,470 --> 02:39:25,180
even if he had the guts to try for it?

2478
02:39:25,389 --> 02:39:29,059
Woman, don't you understand?
I've made you a consort for a king.

2479
02:39:29,268 --> 02:39:32,188
Freddy loves me.
That makes him king enough for me.

2480
02:39:32,396 --> 02:39:35,266
I don't want him to work.
He wasn't brought up to it as I was.

2481
02:39:35,482 --> 02:39:37,072
I'll go and be a teacher.

2482
02:39:37,609 --> 02:39:39,149
What will you teach,
in heaven's name?

2483
02:39:39,653 --> 02:39:42,153
What you taught me.
I'll teach phonetics.

2484
02:39:43,198 --> 02:39:45,698
Ha, ha, ha.

2485
02:39:46,285 --> 02:39:51,035
I'll offer myself as an assistant
to that brilliant Hungarian.

2486
02:39:51,748 --> 02:39:55,588
What, that impostor? That humbug?
That toadying ignoramus?

2487
02:39:55,794 --> 02:39:57,804
Teach him my methods,
my discoveries?

2488
02:39:58,005 --> 02:40:00,965
You take one step in that direction
and I'll wring your neck.

2489
02:40:01,174 --> 02:40:05,514
Wring away. What do I care?
I knew you'd strike me one day.

2490
02:40:08,098 --> 02:40:10,308
That's done you, Henry Higgins,
it has.

2491
02:40:10,517 --> 02:40:14,597
Now, I don't care that
for your bullying and your big talk.

2492
02:40:14,813 --> 02:40:18,483
What a fool I was
What a dominated fool

2493
02:40:18,692 --> 02:40:21,902
To think you were the earth and sky

2494
02:40:22,112 --> 02:40:25,622
What a fool I was
What an elevated fool

2495
02:40:25,824 --> 02:40:29,584
What a mutton-headed dolt was I

2496
02:40:30,245 --> 02:40:33,905
No, my reverberating friend

2497
02:40:34,124 --> 02:40:38,754
You are not the beginning
And the end

2498
02:40:41,048 --> 02:40:42,628
You impudent hussy.

2499
02:40:42,841 --> 02:40:45,341
There's not an idea in your head
or a word in your mouth

2500
02:40:45,552 --> 02:40:47,052
that I haven't put there.

2501
02:40:48,722 --> 02:40:53,982
There'll be spring every year
Without you

2502
02:40:54,186 --> 02:40:57,806
England still will be here
Without you

2503
02:40:58,023 --> 02:41:01,613
There'll be fruit on the tree
And a shore by the sea

2504
02:41:01,818 --> 02:41:05,448
There'll be crumpets and tea
Without you

2505
02:41:05,656 --> 02:41:09,276
Art and music will thrive
Without you

2506
02:41:09,493 --> 02:41:13,043
Somehow Keats will survive
Without you

2507
02:41:13,246 --> 02:41:16,996
And there still will be rain
On that plain down in Spain

2508
02:41:17,209 --> 02:41:20,799
Even that will remain
Without you

2509
02:41:21,004 --> 02:41:24,724
I can do

2510
02:41:24,925 --> 02:41:26,425
Without you

2511
02:41:27,386 --> 02:41:29,966
You, dear friend

2512
02:41:30,180 --> 02:41:34,060
Who talk so well

2513
02:41:34,685 --> 02:41:41,515
You can go to
Hartford, Hereford and Hampshire

2514
02:41:41,733 --> 02:41:45,153
They can still rule the land
Without you

2515
02:41:45,362 --> 02:41:48,952
Windsor Castle will stand
Without you

2516
02:41:49,157 --> 02:41:50,867
And without much ado

2517
02:41:51,076 --> 02:41:53,946
We can all muddle through
Without you

2518
02:41:54,955 --> 02:41:56,955
You brazen hussy.

2519
02:41:57,457 --> 02:42:01,377
Without your pulling it
The tide comes in

2520
02:42:01,586 --> 02:42:05,546
Without your twirling it
The Earth can spin

2521
02:42:05,757 --> 02:42:10,797
Without your pushing them
The clouds roll by

2522
02:42:11,012 --> 02:42:16,232
If they can do without you
Ducky, so can I

2523
02:42:16,435 --> 02:42:19,935
I shall not feel alone
Without you

2524
02:42:20,147 --> 02:42:23,647
I can stand on my own
Without you

2525
02:42:23,859 --> 02:42:27,949
So go back in your shell
I can do bloody well

2526
02:42:28,155 --> 02:42:30,985
- Without--
By George, I really did it

2527
02:42:31,199 --> 02:42:32,239
I did it, I did it

2528
02:42:32,451 --> 02:42:34,871
I said I'd make a woman
And indeed I did

2529
02:42:35,078 --> 02:42:37,708
I knew that I could do it
I knew it, I knew it

2530
02:42:37,914 --> 02:42:40,624
I said I'd make a woman
And succeed I did

2531
02:42:40,834 --> 02:42:42,794
Eliza, you're magnificent.

2532
02:42:43,003 --> 02:42:45,423
Five minutes ago, you were a millstone
around my neck

2533
02:42:45,630 --> 02:42:47,510
and now you're a tower of strength.

2534
02:42:47,716 --> 02:42:50,506
A consort battleship.

2535
02:42:50,719 --> 02:42:52,549
I like you this way.

2536
02:42:54,556 --> 02:42:56,426
Goodbye, Professor Higgins.

2537
02:42:56,641 --> 02:42:59,311
You shall not be seeing me again.

2538
02:43:12,032 --> 02:43:14,332
Mother!

2539
02:43:14,534 --> 02:43:15,624
Mother!

2540
02:43:16,411 --> 02:43:18,501
What is it, Henry?
What's happened?

2541
02:43:20,248 --> 02:43:21,328
She's gone.

2542
02:43:21,541 --> 02:43:23,881
Well, of course, dear.
What did you expect?

2543
02:43:25,337 --> 02:43:26,797
Well...

2544
02:43:27,881 --> 02:43:30,341
- What am I to do?
- Do without, I suppose.

2545
02:43:32,427 --> 02:43:35,427
And so I shall.

2546
02:43:37,474 --> 02:43:40,484
If the Higgins' oxygen burns up
her little lungs,

2547
02:43:40,685 --> 02:43:43,845
let her seek some stuffiness
that suits her.

2548
02:43:44,064 --> 02:43:47,984
She's an owl sickened by a few days
of my sunshine.

2549
02:43:48,193 --> 02:43:49,993
Very well, let her go.
I can do without her.

2550
02:43:50,195 --> 02:43:52,395
I can do without anyone.
I have my own soul.

2551
02:43:52,614 --> 02:43:56,664
My own spark of divine fire.

2552
02:43:59,621 --> 02:44:01,911
Bravo, Eliza.

2553
02:44:21,476 --> 02:44:24,806
Damn, damn, damn, damn

2554
02:44:26,982 --> 02:44:29,022
I've grown accustomed to her face

2555
02:44:32,904 --> 02:44:34,994
She almost makes the day begin

2556
02:44:36,116 --> 02:44:39,326
I've grown accustomed to the tune
That she whistles night and noon

2557
02:44:39,536 --> 02:44:43,206
Her smiles, her frowns
Her ups, her downs

2558
02:44:43,415 --> 02:44:45,325
Are second nature to me now

2559
02:44:46,585 --> 02:44:48,785
Like breathing out and breathing in

2560
02:44:49,921 --> 02:44:53,721
I was serenely independent
And content before we met

2561
02:44:53,925 --> 02:44:57,135
Surely I could always
Be that way again

2562
02:44:58,889 --> 02:45:02,889
And yet I've grown accustomed
To her look

2563
02:45:03,476 --> 02:45:05,306
Accustomed to her voice

2564
02:45:05,979 --> 02:45:10,399
Accustomed to her face

2565
02:45:24,581 --> 02:45:27,541
Marry Freddy.
What an infantile idea.

2566
02:45:27,751 --> 02:45:30,961
What a heartless, wicked,
brainless thing to do.

2567
02:45:31,171 --> 02:45:34,381
But she'll regret it. She'll regret it.

2568
02:45:34,591 --> 02:45:38,391
It's doomed before
they even take the vow.

2569
02:45:38,887 --> 02:45:42,557
I can see her now
Mrs. Freddy Eynsford-Hill

2570
02:45:42,766 --> 02:45:45,306
In a wretched little flat
Above a store

2571
02:45:45,894 --> 02:45:48,654
I can see her now
Not a penny in the till

2572
02:45:48,855 --> 02:45:51,355
And a bill collector
Beating at the door

2573
02:45:51,983 --> 02:45:54,363
She'll try to teach the things
I taught her

2574
02:45:54,861 --> 02:45:57,201
And end up selling flowers instead

2575
02:45:57,864 --> 02:46:00,164
Begging for her bread and water

2576
02:46:00,367 --> 02:46:03,697
While her husband
Has his breakfast in bed

2577
02:46:06,706 --> 02:46:10,956
In a year or so
When she's prematurely gray

2578
02:46:11,169 --> 02:46:14,709
And the blossom in her cheek
Has turned to chalk

2579
02:46:14,923 --> 02:46:16,473
She'll come home, and lo

2580
02:46:16,675 --> 02:46:18,125
He'll have upped and run away

2581
02:46:18,343 --> 02:46:21,103
With a social-climbing heiress
From New York

2582
02:46:21,304 --> 02:46:22,604
Poor Eliza

2583
02:46:22,806 --> 02:46:24,306
How simply frightful

2584
02:46:24,516 --> 02:46:26,556
How humiliating

2585
02:46:26,768 --> 02:46:28,518
How delightful

2586
02:46:31,064 --> 02:46:33,904
How poignant it'll be
On that inevitable night

2587
02:46:34,109 --> 02:46:36,939
When she hammers on my door
In tears and rags

2588
02:46:37,362 --> 02:46:40,612
Miserable and lonely
Repentant and contrite

2589
02:46:41,241 --> 02:46:43,741
Will I take her in
Or hurl her to the wolves?

2590
02:46:43,952 --> 02:46:46,952
Give her kindness
Or the treatment she deserves?

2591
02:46:47,163 --> 02:46:50,753
Will I take her back
Or throw the baggage out?

2592
02:46:53,420 --> 02:46:55,630
Well, I'm a most forgiving man

2593
02:46:56,131 --> 02:46:58,971
The sort who never could
Ever would

2594
02:46:59,175 --> 02:47:02,925
Take a position
And staunchly never budge

2595
02:47:05,765 --> 02:47:07,885
A most forgiving man

2596
02:47:10,812 --> 02:47:13,192
But I shall never take her back

2597
02:47:14,065 --> 02:47:15,975
If she were crawling on her knees

2598
02:47:16,818 --> 02:47:19,398
Let her promise to atone
Let her shiver, let her moan

2599
02:47:19,612 --> 02:47:23,702
I'll slam the door
And let the hellcat freeze

2600
02:47:26,369 --> 02:47:29,869
Marry Freddy. Ha!

2601
02:47:42,886 --> 02:47:48,216
But I'm so used to hear her say
Good morning every day

2602
02:47:48,433 --> 02:47:53,653
Her joys, her woes
Her highs, her lows

2603
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:56,315
Are second nature to me now

2604
02:47:57,817 --> 02:48:00,317
Like breathing out and breathing in

2605
02:48:01,946 --> 02:48:03,856
I'm very grateful she's a woman

2606
02:48:04,074 --> 02:48:05,874
And so easy to forget

2607
02:48:06,534 --> 02:48:10,374
Rather like a habit
One can always break

2608
02:48:12,457 --> 02:48:17,587
And yet I've grown
Accustomed to the trace

2609
02:48:17,796 --> 02:48:20,706
Of something in the air

2610
02:48:21,716 --> 02:48:27,006
Accustomed to her face

2611
02:50:04,194 --> 02:50:05,864
ELIZA :
Oh, we are proud.

2612
02:50:06,070 --> 02:50:09,200
He ain't above giving lessons, not him.
I heard him say so.

2613
02:50:09,407 --> 02:50:11,407
Well, I ain't come here
to ask for any compliment,

2614
02:50:11,618 --> 02:50:14,538
and if my money's not good enough,
I can go elsewhere.

2615
02:50:14,746 --> 02:50:15,946
HIGGINS:
Good enough for what?

2616
02:50:16,164 --> 02:50:17,624
ELIZA:
Good enough for you.

2617
02:50:17,832 --> 02:50:18,962
Now you know, don't you?

2618
02:50:19,167 --> 02:50:21,457
I'm come to have lessons,
I am, and to pay for them too,

2619
02:50:21,669 --> 02:50:22,709
make no mistake.

2620
02:50:22,921 --> 02:50:24,211
PICKERING:
What is it you want, my girl?

2621
02:50:24,422 --> 02:50:27,222
ELIZA:
I want to be a lady in a flower shop

2622
02:50:27,425 --> 02:50:30,385
instead of selling at the corner
of Tottenham Court Road.

2623
02:50:30,595 --> 02:50:33,555
But they won't take me
unless I can talk more genteel.

2624
02:50:33,765 --> 02:50:35,595
He said he could teach me.

2625
02:50:35,808 --> 02:50:36,848
Well, here I am.

2626
02:50:37,060 --> 02:50:39,020
Ready to pay,
not asking any favor.

2627
02:50:39,229 --> 02:50:41,229
And he treats me as if I was dirt.

2628
02:50:41,439 --> 02:50:45,729
I know what lessons cost as well
as you do, and I'm ready to pay.

2629
02:50:45,944 --> 02:50:48,994
I won't give more than a schilling.
Take it or leave it.

2630
02:50:49,197 --> 02:50:53,527
HIGGINS: It's almost irresistible.
She's so deliciously low.

2631
02:50:54,160 --> 02:50:55,870
So horribly dirty.

2632
02:50:56,079 --> 02:50:57,249
I'll take it.

2633
02:50:57,455 --> 02:51:00,865
I'll make a duchess
of this draggle-tailed guttersnipe.

2634
02:51:02,585 --> 02:51:06,125
I washed my face and hands
before I come, I did.

2635
02:51:14,305 --> 02:51:16,055
Eliza?

2636
02:51:19,852 --> 02:51:21,562
Where the devil are my slippers?
